A VR video player for the Valve Steam Frame. It plays flat, 180°, 360° and fisheye videos, in 2D or 3D, from the headset, a microSD card, a USB drive or a media server. It runs natively on the headset.

> [!NOTE]
> FramePlayerX is a fork of [FramePlayer](https://github.com/yellkell/frameplayer) by [yellkell](https://github.com/yellkell), who created the original player and released it as open source. Thank you, yellkell, for the work this project is built on.

## Features

- **VR and flat videos**: plays 180°, 360°, fisheye and flat videos, in 2D or 3D. The format is detected automatically, and you can change it for any video
- **Hardware decoding**: HEVC (H.265) in 8 and 10 bits and H.264, both up to 8K, and VP9 play on the Frame's own video decoder. Anything else, AV1 included, plays with software decoding
- **3D Blu-ray**: disc images (`.iso`), MKV rips and the disc's `.ssif` files play in full 3D (H.264 MVC) on the hardware decoder
- **Picture adjustments**: position, zoom, depth, picture settings and fisheye lens calibration, saved for each video, and a screen that follows your head for watching lying down
- **Videos on the headset**: browse any folder on the headset, a microSD card or a USB drive, including cards formatted on Windows or a Mac, and make libraries of your folders, with thumbnails, filters and sorting
- **Media servers**: browse and play from Jellyfin, Emby, any server with a DeoVR feed or HereSphere API, network shares (SMB), WebDAV, DLNA servers and web folders. Jellyfin, Emby and HereSphere APIs hear what you watch, so their resume points, watched marks and play counts stay in step with the headset
- **Watch history, Up next and playlists**: carry on where you left off, queue what plays next, keep playlists of videos from any source, and mark favorites and ratings
- **PIN locks**: hide a source behind a PIN until you unlock it
- **Passthrough videos**: see your room around the people in passthrough videos, and behind green or blue screens
- **Subtitles and spatial audio**: subtitles from a file or inside the video, picked in your language and shown in any script, and 360° audio that follows your head
- **Haptic devices**: optional, off until turned on; syncs supported haptic devices with videos that have scripts
- **Phone remote**: open the address the headset shows on your phone and enter its code, then control the player and type into the headset from the phone. Apps made for DeoVR's remote work too
- **Custom controls**: choose what each controller button does
- **Languages**: English, German, Spanish, French, Japanese and Simplified Chinese, following the language Steam is set to; the phone remote follows the headset
- **Updates**: checks for a new version when it starts, and installs it from Settings when you choose to, on a Stable or a Beta channel
- **No accounts or tracking**: it only connects to the servers you add, and to GitHub to check for updates. After a crash it asks whether to send a crash report, shows what's in it (no video names, folders or server addresses) and sends nothing unless you choose to

## Quick Start

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://github.com/remotesojourner/frameplayerx/releases/latest/download/Install-FramePlayerX.desktop"><img src="assets/install-button.svg" alt="Install in Desktop Mode" width="240" /></a>
  <!-- <a href="https://framedropvr.com/install?manifest=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fremotesojourner%2Fframeplayerx%2Freleases%2Flatest%2Fdownload%2Fframedrop.json"><img src="assets/framedrop-button.svg" alt="Install with FrameDrop" width="240" /></a> -->
  <a href="https://remotesojourner.github.io/frameplayerx/frame-control.html"><img src="assets/frame-control-button.svg" alt="Install with Frame Control" width="240" /></a>
</p>

1. **Install FramePlayerX** with one of the buttons above, or from a terminal:

   - **Desktop Mode, on the headset**: open this page in the headset's browser and press **Desktop Mode** to download the installer. Open `Install-FramePlayerX.desktop` from your Downloads folder and confirm when Desktop Mode asks whether to trust it. A terminal window opens, installs the latest release and adds FramePlayerX to your Steam library. It may ask to close Steam for a moment; the app then shows up in Gaming Mode.

   <!-- - **FrameDrop or Frame Control, from a PC**: turn on Developer Mode (Steam Settings › System › Developer Mode) and pair the headset once with [FrameDrop](https://framedropvr.com) or [Frame Control](https://github.com/saphid/steam-frame). Then press its button in your PC's browser and it installs the latest release on the headset. -->
   - **Frame Control from a PC**: turn on Developer Mode (Steam Settings › System › Developer Mode) and pair the headset once with [Frame Control](https://github.com/saphid/steam-frame). Then press its button in your PC's browser and it installs the latest release on the headset.
     > **Note:** [FrameDrop](https://framedropvr.com) currently has a bug where it has trouble downloading from GitHub, so it isn't supported yet, but should be once the bug is fixed.

   - **`frameplayerx-install`, from a PC's terminal**: turn on Developer Mode, download `frameplayerx-install` for your PC from the [release page](https://github.com/remotesojourner/frameplayerx/releases/latest), then:

     ```bash
     frameplayerx-install pair 192.168.0.68    # once, with the headset's IP address
     frameplayerx-install                      # installs the latest release
     ```

     For `pair`, open Steam Settings › Developer › Pair new host on the headset and keep it showing.

2. **Start it** from the Steam library on the headset. Browse the headset and its cards under **On this device**, and add a library of a folder, or a media server, under **Sources › Add source**.

To update later, open **Settings › Updates** and press **Download and install** when a new version is listed, then **Restart now**. To remove it again, see [Uninstall](docs/USER-GUIDE.md#uninstall) in the user guide.

## Help translate

FramePlayerX comes in English, German, Spanish, French, Japanese and Simplified Chinese. All but English started as machine drafts, so some wording is likely to be wrong or awkward, and corrections are welcome.

- **Correct or translate** on [Codeberg Translate](https://translate.codeberg.org/projects/frameplayerx/), Codeberg's Weblate. No Git needed: sign in with a Codeberg account, pick a language and edit its messages. A note beside each message says where it shows; "Short" marks a button, chip or tab, which should stay about as long as the English. Changes come back to this repository as pull requests.
- **Report a mistake** without translating: open a [Translation problem](https://github.com/remotesojourner/frameplayerx/issues/new?template=translation.yml) issue with the language, where it shows and the wording you'd expect.
- **Add a language**: start it on Codeberg Translate, or ask in an issue. Right-to-left languages (Arabic, Hebrew) and scripts that need shaping (Thai, Hindi and other Indic scripts) can't be shown in the interface yet.

## FAQ

### Does it run on other headsets?

No. FramePlayerX is built only for the Steam Frame, so it can use the Frame's decoder, controllers and runtime directly instead of carrying everything a cross-platform player needs.

---

### Why does a video stutter?

Usually because it's AV1 or 4:2:2, which the Frame's hardware decoder can't play, so it's decoded on the CPU. The control bar says so. Converting it to HEVC once on a PC makes it play smoothly; the [user guide](docs/USER-GUIDE.md#videos-that-stutter-av1-and-422) has the commands.

---

### Does it work with my media server or NAS?

Yes, if it offers one of these: Jellyfin (sign in with Quick Connect or a password), Emby (a password), a DeoVR feed or HereSphere API, SMB, WebDAV or DLNA. Add it under Sources › Add source.

---

### Will it be released on Steam?

Not for now. I develop FramePlayerX for myself in my free time, and I don't see the point in paying Steam's $100 fee to publish it. If donations through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/remotesojourner) ever reach that amount, I'll spend them on releasing it on Steam. I don't expect any, though: it's an app built with the help of AI to solve an immediate need of my own. Meanwhile, the installers in [Quick Start](#quick-start) add it to your Steam library like a game.

---

### Why a fork instead of contributing to FramePlayer?

FramePlayer reached Jellyfin, where most of the films I wanted to watch are, only through DLNA, and I wanted to use it directly. It also didn't support half side-by-side videos. I also had a different idea for browsing sources than its library screen, and while FramePlayer focuses on adult videos, I wanted a player for every kind of media. Together that made a different app rather than a few changes to the original.

---

### Do you plan to add new features?

If I come across a new idea or receive a suggestion that fits a VR video player for the Frame, I will consider adding it, but there are no promises: this project exists to solve my own needs first.
