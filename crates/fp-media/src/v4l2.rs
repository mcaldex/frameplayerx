//! Native V4L2 stateful (memory-to-memory) video decoder for H.264 and HEVC.
//!
//! FFmpeg's `*_v4l2m2m` wrappers cannot open large streams on the Steam
//! Frame: the qcom iris driver's admission check (`check_core_mbps_mbpf`)
//! multiplies the *new* session's macroblocks per frame by the number of
//! open instances, idle ones and encoders too (Steam's own `vrlink` and its
//! recording among them), so an 8192x4096 stream fails `VIDIOC_REQBUFS` with
//! `ENOMEM` as soon as one other instance exists, although the hardware
//! decodes it at well over 60 fps. Past [`MAX_SESSION_MACROBLOCKS`] it fails
//! with nothing else open.
//!
//! This decoder drives the device directly and works around the check:
//!
//! 1. The OUTPUT (bitstream) queue is configured for the stream's size. When
//!    `REQBUFS` fails with `ENOMEM`, the declared height is lowered to the
//!    largest 32-aligned height the driver accepts ([`capped_height`]).
//! 2. In that case an embedded IDR picture (the "primer") is queued ahead of
//!    the stream: a black HEVC frame with just few enough macroblocks to
//!    pass the check when CAPTURE is allocated, yet the same coding tree
//!    blocks and CAPTURE buffers as the stream ([`primer_matches`]):
//!    8192x4080 for an 8-bit 8192x4096 stream, 8160x4096 for a 10-bit one.
//! 3. When the real stream's `SOURCE_CHANGE` arrives, the existing CAPTURE
//!    buffers are reused ([`can_reuse_capture`]): decoding resumes with
//!    `V4L2_DEC_CMD_START`, which skips the check `STREAMON` would run again.
//!
//! Reuse is only allowed when the new CAPTURE format is exactly the one the
//! buffers were allocated for. Resuming a much larger stream on buffers of a
//! smaller one (even with big enough CAPTURE buffers, e.g. imported DMA-BUFs)
//! makes the firmware write past its internal buffers: SMMU faults and a
//! firmware restart that takes down every other decoder session (tested).
//! Any other resolution change reallocates CAPTURE the standard way.
//!
//! Seeks never restart a queue (that would re-run the check): queued
//! bitstream from before the seek is decoded and its frames are dropped by
//! timestamp. Decoded frames are copied out of the driver's buffers into
//! pooled `AVFrame`s, so the CAPTURE buffers go straight back to the decoder.
//!
//! 10-bit HEVC comes out correctly only as Q10C, Qualcomm's compressed TP10
//! ([`Q10cLayout`]): asked for NV12, the decoder clamps the 10-bit samples
//! to 8 bits instead of scaling them. Q10C pictures are copied out whole
//! and only the GPU reads them. Their primer is narrower instead of
//! shorter: the driver sizes Q10C CAPTURE buffers by the exact picture
//! height (8192x4080 and 8192x4096 differ, and a requested size is
//! ignored) but rounds the width up to 192, so an 8160x4096 picture gets
//! the buffers of an 8192x4096 one.
