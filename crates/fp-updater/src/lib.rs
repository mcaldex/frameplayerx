//! In-app self-update for FramePlayerX.
//!
//! The update flow:
//!
//! 1. [`check`] fetches the release manifest (`manifest.json`) and its
//!    detached ed25519 signature (`manifest.json.sig`), verifies the
//!    signature against [`RELEASE_PUBLIC_KEY`], and compares versions with
//!    semver for the user's [`Channel`]. [`check_channel`] finds that
//!    manifest among FramePlayerX's GitHub releases.
//! 2. [`download`] streams the zip to disk with resume (HTTP `Range`) and
//!    verifies size and SHA-256 from the signed manifest.
//! 3. [`install()`] extracts into a staging directory beside the install
//!    directory, validates it, and swaps it in with renames, keeping one
//!    previous version for [`rollback`].
//!
//! The crate also carries the [`framedrop`] manifest used by the community
//! installers (Frame Control, FrameDrop) and the `fp-release` maintainer
//! tool that generates keys, manifests and signatures.
