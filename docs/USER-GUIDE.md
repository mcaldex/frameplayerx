# FramePlayerX user guide

FramePlayerX plays flat, 180°, 360°, fisheye and YouTube-style (EAC) videos,
2D or 3D, on the Steam Frame, from the headset, a microSD card, a USB drive
or your network.

## Install

**On the headset, in Desktop Mode (no PC).** Open this page in the
headset's browser and press the button to download the installer:

<a href="https://github.com/remotesojourner/frameplayerx/releases/latest/download/Install-FramePlayerX.desktop"><img src="../assets/install-button.svg" alt="Install in Desktop Mode" width="240" /></a>

Open `Install-FramePlayerX.desktop` from your Downloads folder and confirm
when Desktop Mode asks whether to trust it. A terminal window opens and:

- downloads the latest stable release and checks it against the checksum
  GitHub recorded for it;
- removes other copies of FramePlayerX and their library entries (your
  settings and watch history stay);
- installs it into `~/frameplayerx` and adds **FramePlayerX** to the Steam
  library with its artwork.

If Steam can't be updated while it's running, the installer asks to close
it; the app then appears when you return to Gaming Mode, which it offers to
do. Run the same file again to reinstall. From a terminal, the installer
also takes `--beta` (the newest release, betas included); see
[tools/frame-desktop-install](../tools/frame-desktop-install/README.md).

The other two ways need **Developer Mode** on, and the headset paired once
with your PC by `frameplayerx-install pair` (below), Frame Control,
FrameDrop or Valve's SteamOS Devkit Client.

**With FrameDrop or Frame Control, from a PC.** With the app running on
your PC and the headset paired, press the button in your PC's browser:

<a href="https://framedropvr.com/install?manifest=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fremotesojourner%2Fframeplayerx%2Freleases%2Flatest%2Fdownload%2Fframedrop.json"><img src="../assets/framedrop-button.svg" alt="Install with FrameDrop" width="240" /></a>
<a href="https://remotesojourner.github.io/frameplayerx/frame-control.html"><img src="../assets/frame-control-button.svg" alt="Install with Frame Control" width="240" /></a>

GitHub doesn't keep links that open apps, so the Frame Control button opens a
small page that opens Frame Control. If that doesn't work, paste this link
into the browser's address bar instead:

```
frame-control://install?manifest=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fremotesojourner%2Fframeplayerx%2Freleases%2Flatest%2Fdownload%2Fframeplayerx.json
```

Either app reads the release's manifest (`framedrop.json` or
`frameplayerx.json`), downloads the latest release, checks its SHA-256 and
unpacks it into `~/frameplayerx`.

**From a PC with the installer.** Download `frameplayerx-install` for your
PC from the release page and run it:

```
frameplayerx-install pair 192.168.0.68       # once: the headset's IP address
frameplayerx-install                         # latest release
frameplayerx-install --channel beta          # newest release, betas too
frameplayerx-install --zip frameplayerx-0.1.0-aarch64.zip
frameplayerx-install status | uninstall
```

To pair, open Steam Settings › Developer › Pair new host on the headset
and keep that screen showing while `pair` runs. It creates an RSA key
(`~/.ssh/id_rsa_frame_devkit`; the headset does not accept ed25519 keys),
registers it with the headset and adds a `Host frame` entry to
`~/.ssh/config`. If you skip this step, `frameplayerx-install` offers to
pair when it cannot log in.

It reuses the `frame` SSH alias created when pairing, installs into
`~/frameplayerx` (keeping the previous version as `~/frameplayerx.old`) and
adds **FramePlayerX** to the Steam library with artwork. Add
`--restart-steam` to make it show up right away.

**By hand.** Copy the zip to the headset, unzip it into your home folder
and add `~/frameplayerx/frameplayerx.sh` to Steam as a non-Steam game.

## Updating

FramePlayerX checks for a new version each time it starts, but doesn't
install it by itself. To update, open **Settings › Updates**: when a new
version is out it's listed there with what changed. Press **Download and
install**, then **Restart now**. **Check now** looks again without
restarting.

The **Stable** channel gets finished releases only; **Beta** also gets
test versions before they are released. Switch off **Check for updates at
start** to only check when you press **Check now**. Installing again with
any of the ways above also updates it.

## Uninstall

Uninstalling removes the app, its entry in the Steam library and its
library artwork. You choose whether your settings, source passwords, watch
history and thumbnails go too; kept, a later install picks up where you
left off. Your videos are never touched.

**On the headset, in Desktop Mode (no PC).** Open this page in the
headset's browser and press the button to download the uninstaller:

<a href="https://github.com/remotesojourner/frameplayerx/releases/latest/download/Uninstall-FramePlayerX.desktop"><img src="../assets/uninstall-button.svg" alt="Uninstall in Desktop Mode" width="240" /></a>

Open `Uninstall-FramePlayerX.desktop` from your Downloads folder and
confirm when Desktop Mode asks whether to trust it. A terminal window
opens, asks you to confirm, removes FramePlayerX, then asks whether to
delete your settings and watch history too. If it closes Steam, the entry
is gone when you return to Gaming Mode, which it offers to do.

From Konsole, the same installer's `--remove` does this, and
`--remove --purge` deletes your settings and watch history without asking:

```
curl -fsSL https://github.com/remotesojourner/frameplayerx/releases/latest/download/frameplayerx-desktop-install.py -o /tmp/frameplayerx-desktop-install.py
python3 /tmp/frameplayerx-desktop-install.py --remove
```

**From a PC.** With the headset still paired (Developer Mode on):

```
frameplayerx-install uninstall                  # keeps your settings and watch history
frameplayerx-install uninstall --purge          # deletes them too
```

Add `--restart-steam` so the library updates right away.

**Installed with Frame Control or FrameDrop.** They install into the same
folder, `~/frameplayerx`, so either way above removes it.

**By hand.** Delete the `frameplayerx` and `frameplayerx.old` folders in
your home folder, and remove FramePlayerX from the Steam library.

**Deleting your settings and watch history later.** If you kept them, or
removed the app by hand, they stay behind. To delete them, run this in
Konsole on the headset:

```
rm -rf ~/.config/frameplayerx ~/.local/share/frameplayerx ~/.cache/frameplayerx
```

| Folder | What's in it |
|---|---|
| `~/.config/frameplayerx` | Settings, your sources and their passwords |
| `~/.local/share/frameplayerx` | The watch history, ratings, adjustments, the log, and the `Interactive` folder, including any haptic scripts you put there |
| `~/.cache/frameplayerx` | Thumbnails, and pictures from your servers |

If you paired a PC with `frameplayerx-install pair` and nothing else uses
that pairing, you can also delete `~/.ssh/id_rsa_frame_devkit` and
`~/.ssh/id_rsa_frame_devkit.pub` on the PC, and the `Host frame` entry in
`~/.ssh/config`.

## Where your videos can be

| Where | How |
|---|---|
| Any folder on the headset, a microSD card or a USB drive | Browse it under Home › On this device, or make it a library: Sources › Add source › Library |
| Any server with a DeoVR feed or HereSphere API | Sources › Add source › DeoVR or HereSphere |
| NAS / Windows share | Sources › Add source › SMB share: a whole server (`smb://nas/`, which lists the shares your login, or a guest without one, may open) or one share or folder (`smb://nas/videos`) |
| Any computer with SSH (Linux, macOS, many NAS) | Sources › Add source › SFTP (see [Connecting over SFTP](#connecting-over-sftp)) |
| Nextcloud and other WebDAV | Sources › Add source › WebDAV |
| Jellyfin, Emby | Sources › Add source › Jellyfin / Emby (a password, or Quick Connect on Jellyfin) |

| A web server folder listing | Sources › Add source › HTTP |

### Home, watch history and browsing

**Home** opens on what you were watching (a banner to resume, then
*Continue watching* and *Favorites*) and ends with a row of your sources:
**On this device** first, then your libraries and every other source you
added, then *Add a source*.
Each opens in a browser made for that kind of source; Back returns to Home.
Its title is always the source's name, with where you are in it underneath.
Sources locked with a PIN stay off Home until unlocked; the padlock on a
tile locks it (or, without a PIN yet, asks for one).

Point at a title that is cut short, here or on the control bar, to read it
whole.

On a video's card the picture plays it and the title under it opens its
details: your rating and favorite, its format, *Play next*, *Add to queue*
and *Add to playlist*, and what its server says about it (Jellyfin's story,
a DeoVR or HereSphere scene's description, their tags), kept with the video
and brought up to date each time it opens; library search finds those
tags too. In a folder, the ⋯ on a video's row offers
the same.

**Watch history** lists everything you have played, from any source, with
the same search, format filters and orders (recently watched, title, most
watched, rating, length). Remove one video from its details with *Remove
from history*, or everything with *Clear history*; favorites and ratings
stay. Browsing a network source never adds anything here. Removing a source
forgets its videos, except those you watched, marked or put in a playlist.

A video you stopped part way shows the frame where you left off, made
shortly after it stops. Past 90 % it counts as watched: its card gets a ✓,
it starts from the beginning next time and shows its usual picture again.
A video from Jellyfin, Emby, DLNA or a DeoVR or HereSphere server shows the
server's picture; any other gets a thumbnail made on the headset. Pictures
from servers are kept on the headset so they aren't downloaded each time.

**Settings › General › Thumbnails** holds these:

- **Make thumbnails**: off, no new thumbnails are made (the ones made stay).
- **Show where you left off**: off, videos show their usual picture, and the
  frames already made are deleted.
- **Image cache**: how much room server pictures take (500 MB unless you
  pick another size); the ones used longest ago make room for new ones.
  **Clear** deletes them all, so each is downloaded again.

Thumbnails of videos that leave the library, say when you remove a source,
are deleted too.

### Up next and playlists

**Up next** is the list of videos playing in turn; the button beside
Browse on the control bar shows it over the video. Opening a video plays it
alone. **Play all**, at the top of a folder, a library's Videos, a
Jellyfin, Emby or Plex grid, season or search, a scene grid or a playlist,
makes that page's videos Up next and plays the first. On a server's grid
it's the first 300 in the grid's order, as Jellyfin's own Play does;
pointing at the button says so. **⏮** and **⏭** either side of the play
button (or X and Y) step through Up next; pointing at one names the video
it goes to, and it dims at either end of the list or when a video plays
alone. With **Autoplay** on, the next starts when one ends. *Play
next* (after the video playing) and *Add to queue* (at the end) are on a
video's details, a Jellyfin or scene page and a folder row's ⋯; with
nothing playing, either plays it. On the Up next page, pick a video to play
it, move videos up or down, take them out, *Clear* everything but the video
playing, or *Save as playlist*.

**Shuffle** on the Up next page puts the current video first and every
other entry in a new random order, including entries that came before it.
The current video keeps playing; press **Shuffle** again for another order.
To keep this order as a playlist, press **Save as playlist** afterwards.

**Autoplay** (the play sign in a circular arrow, on the control bar) plays
Up next through: the next video starts when one ends. Off, a video stops
at its end, and ⏭ plays the next.
**Loop** on the Up next page plays the first video again after the last,
and ⏮ and ⏭ step round the list past either end. The repeat key beside Up
next on the control bar loops the video playing instead: it starts again
from the beginning each time it ends, before anything in Up next. All
three stay on, from video to video and after a restart, until you turn
them off.

**Playlists**, a tab beside Watch history, holds your playlists: make one
there or with *Add to playlist*, which offers your playlists and a name
for a new one. A playlist can hold videos from any source. Its page plays
them all from the top or from the one you pick, moves them up or down,
takes them out, and renames or deletes the playlist (*Delete* asks again).
Videos of a source locked with a PIN are left out until it is unlocked.

| Source | What browsing it offers |
|---|---|
| On this device | The home folder and the inserted microSD card and USB drives, as folders: play any video, or *Play all* in a folder |
| Library | **Videos**: every video in its folder, with thumbnails, search, format filters and sorting (newest, title, length, rating, shuffle). **Folders**: its folder as folders. **Scan now** looks for new and removed videos |
| Jellyfin / Emby | Your libraries, *Continue watching*, *Next up* and the latest additions; a search of the whole server by title, as Jellyfin's own search shows it: a row each of movies, shows, collections and other videos, best matches first (episodes are found through their show), a *People* row of the cast and crew whose names match (tap one to see what they are in), and a *Tagged* row of what carries a tag with your words in it; poster grids searched, sorted (title, date added, release date, rating, length, last watched, shuffle) and filtered by the server: unwatched, in progress, favorites, and **Filters** for genres, decades, resolution, studios and tags; series by season and episode; details with the story, cast, genres and tags (tap a tag to see everything that has it), and a *Version* row when the server keeps more than one version of a video (4K and 1080p, a director's cut): *Automatic* plays the tallest that fits the source's maximum height; pick another and the video plays from it wherever you open it (subtitles included) until the app closes. Each version keeps its own format and adjustments, as a separate video in your history. Watched marks, favorites and resume points are the server's (see [Watch sync](#watch-sync-with-jellyfin-emby-plex-and-heresphere)) |
| DeoVR feed / HereSphere API | The server's scene groups as chips over a grid of scenes; search the chosen group (or *All*) across titles, studios, performers and tags; order by title, date, rating or length, either way, or shuffle; *Favorites* (and *Scripted*, with haptics on), and **Filters** for studio, people, tags, length, format and rating, each with how many scenes have it (a DeoVR feed's studios, tags and performers come with each scene's details, fetched while you search or filter and kept for next time). ⋯ opens a scene's details: description, performers and tags (tap one to see all their scenes), chapters to start from, and ♡ to make it a favourite on a HereSphere API that takes favourites. The page opens with the scenes from last time while the server sends the current list ("updating…" under the title). A HereSphere API can also sync watch state (see [Watch sync](#watch-sync-with-jellyfin-emby-plex-and-heresphere)) |
| Plex | Movie, TV and personal-video libraries; Continue watching and recent additions; server search, sorted and shuffled grids, unwatched and in-progress filters, and genre, studio and decade filters. Shows open by season and episode; details include artwork, chapters and available versions. Resume points and watched marks belong to the selected Plex account. Plex server favorites, people and tag browsing are not offered. App playlists, Up next, history and format adjustments work as with other video sources |
| SMB, SFTP, WebDAV, HTTP folders, DLNA, local folders | Folders and files: search the folder you are in, order by name, date or size, *Play all* |

**Filters** opens a drawer on the right: what you pick there applies at
once, any of the choices in a section and all of the sections together,
and each shows as a chip under the sorts; press a chip to take it off, or
*Clear all*. A long section (people, tags, studios, genres) has a box to
find one and shows a few, with **Show all** for the rest. **Shuffle** puts a list in a new random order each time you
pick it or press **Shuffle again**; opening a video's page and coming back
keeps the order. Grids load more as you scroll to their end.

### Connecting Plex

Under **Sources › Add source › Plex**, **Link with code** is selected by
default. Press **Get pairing code**, then visit [plex.tv/link](https://plex.tv/link)
on your phone or computer. Sign in to Plex there if asked and enter the
code shown in FramePlayerX. The headset waits for approval, then shows
your servers. Choose an owned or shared server, wait for its connection
test, then **Save**. If the code expires, get another code and try again;
**Cancel** stops waiting.

The **Access token** option instead accepts a Plex Media Server address
and an existing access token; test the connection before saving. A manual
token cannot be renewed automatically. If a source linked with an earlier
build fails authentication, link it again. Linking again or replacing a manual
token creates a separate source, keeping the existing source and its
history separate from the new account.

**Connection** offers three modes:

- **Local only** (the default for new sources): use Plex's advertised LAN
  addresses, without remote addresses or Relay.
- **Direct connections**: try LAN addresses first, then direct remote
  addresses, without Relay. Remote addresses have to use HTTPS, because your
  token goes with every request. If Plex only lists plain HTTP for your server,
  set its **Secure connections** to Preferred or Required.
- **Direct + Relay**: try direct connections first, then Plex Relay if needed.

Local playback is free. Remote video requires **Plex Pass** for you or
the server owner, or **Remote Watch Pass** for you. Plex may treat another
subnet or VLAN as remote even when using a LAN address; choosing Local only
does not change that classification. Editing a source keeps its saved mode.
Changing the mode rechecks the selected server before saving. For manual
Local-only setup with an access token, use a LAN IP address.

Relay must also be enabled on the server. It can work without opening a
router port, but is limited to 2 Mbit/s and has the same remote-playback
subscription requirements. With Relay, Automatic requests a lower bitrate
transcode when the original exceeds the limit; you can also select a quality
explicitly. Direct remote access needs a reachable server connection; port
forwarding, a VPN or a reachable reverse proxy are possible ways to provide
one. See Plex's
[Relay documentation](https://support.plex.tv/articles/216766168-accessing-a-server-through-relay/)
and [remote playback requirements](https://support.plex.tv/articles/requirements-for-remote-playback-of-personal-media/).

Plex's `*.plex.direct` hostnames are normal HTTPS server addresses. Some
routers or DNS providers block their resolution through DNS rebinding
protection; see [Plex's secure connection guide](https://support.plex.tv/articles/206225077-how-to-use-secure-server-connections/).
If DNS lookup fails or the connection times out or cannot be opened,
FramePlayerX tries that connection's advertised IP address and port, when
available. It keeps the original HTTPS hostname and certificate checks, and verifies
the server's identity. The log records the IP attempt. This fallback does
not apply to Relay. Across VLANs, the headset still needs a route and
firewall permission to the server's port.

`app.plex.tv` provides the web app and account sign-in. FramePlayerX uses
the selected server's media connection; entering `app.plex.tv` in the
manual address field starts account linking. Plex Home profile switching,
live TV, music, photos, cloud Watchlist and casting are not supported.

### Connecting over SFTP

Any computer you can sign in to with SSH can be a source: Linux, macOS and
many NAS. Under **Sources › Add source › SFTP**, the address says which
folder to open:

| Address | Opens |
|---|---|
| `sftp://pc.local/` | Your home folder on the server |
| `sftp://pc.local/~/Videos` | A folder in your home folder |
| `sftp://pc.local/srv/media` | Any other folder, from the top of the server's disk |

Add the port after the name (`sftp://pc.local:2222/`) if the server doesn't
use 22. A user name is always needed; one in the address
(`sftp://me@pc.local/`) works as well as the **User name** field.

Sign in with a password, a key file, or both: the key is tried first.
A key file is a private key on the headset, from OpenSSH (`id_ed25519`,
`id_rsa`) or PuTTY (`.ppk`). Copy it to `~/.ssh` or `~/Downloads` on the
headset and it's listed under the field: tap it to use it. If the key is
password-protected, a **Key passphrase** row appears: enter the passphrase
you set when you made the key, not your account password.

The first time it connects, FramePlayerX remembers the server's identity
key. If the server later answers with a different key, the source stops
with an error instead of signing in. If you reinstalled the server or gave
it a new key, remove the source and add it again; otherwise another
machine may be answering in its place.

Files and folders whose names start with a dot (hidden on Linux and macOS)
aren't listed.

### Locking a source with a PIN

To keep a share or folder private when someone else uses the headset, press
the padlock next to it under **Sources** (or on its tile on Home) and choose
a PIN (4 to 8 digits). While it is locked it can't be browsed, it is left
off Home, and its videos are left out of the watch history, search and the
phone remote; opening one asks for the PIN. **Unlock** opens it until
FramePlayerX restarts; one press of the padlock locks it again. To change
the PIN or remove it, edit the source (the pencil under **Sources**).
Removing the source also removes its PIN. This keeps guests out, it doesn't
encrypt anything: the files themselves stay as they are.

A PIN locks that one source only. Another source on the same server, or
with the same folder, stays open: lock it too, with the same PIN or its
own, if it shows the same videos.

### Parallel downloads

A server's form has a **Parallel downloads** switch, off by default. On, FramePlayerX downloads several parts of a video at once over separate connections while it plays, the way some download managers do. This helps if the server limits the speed of each connection. If it doesn't, the switch may gain nothing, and a server on hard drives can get slower, because the drives have to jump between parts of the file. SMB shares, SFTP servers and DLNA servers don't have the switch.

### Editing a source

The pencil next to a source under **Sources** opens its details: rename it,
change its address, user name and password, or its PIN. Its type stays; a
Jellyfin server signed in with Quick Connect keeps that sign-in
unless you clear it.

When a network server's URL, IP address or root folder changes, edit the
existing source. History, resume points, playlists and adjustments follow
the same relative paths or server item IDs. Removing and adding the source
again creates a different identity.

HTTP(S), WebDAV, SMB and SFTP use paths relative to the configured root.
Jellyfin and Emby use item and version IDs; DLNA uses object IDs, and Plex
keeps its server and item IDs. Feeds keep scene, media and artwork URLs
exactly as published, unless a stable scene ID allows a fresh lookup.
Changing a feed's address alone cannot identify changed video URLs.

Older saved URLs are converted in place when their identity is known.
Browsing the source can identify more old links. Unknown external or
signed URLs, and unidentified old DLNA links, cannot be recovered just
from a new server address.

### Watch sync with Jellyfin, Emby, Plex and HereSphere

These servers keep track of what you watch, and FramePlayerX keeps them in
step with the headset:

- **Jellyfin and Emby** hear when a video starts, pauses, resumes, jumps or
  changes speed, where it is every 10 seconds, and where it stopped. The
  server keeps the resume point, counts the play and marks the video
  watched when you stop near the end; its dashboard shows it playing on the
  headset. A video starts at the server's resume point, also when opened
  from Watch history or Home, so you can carry on where you left off on
  another device. ♡ and ✓ *Watched* on a Jellyfin page change the marks on
  the server at once.
- **HereSphere APIs** that ask for playback events get the ones HereSphere
  itself sends (open, play, pause and close, with the position), from which
  the server counts plays and keeps resume points. ♡ on a scene's page
  makes it a favourite on a server that takes favourites.
- **Plex** receives playing, paused and stopped timeline reports, with the
  current position and duration. Its resume point takes precedence over
  local history, including a zero position after a reset on another device.
  ✓ **Watched** changes the server's played state. Explicitly marking a
  video watched does not create a playback-history entry on the server.

Reports go out in the background and in order. Quitting waits a few
seconds for the last ones; one the server doesn't take (it is offline, or
the sign-in expired) is noted in frameplayerx.log and not sent again.

DeoVR feeds, DLNA, network shares and folders keep no watch state on the
server: their resume points, favorites and ratings stay on the headset.

### Libraries

A library is a folder of videos, on the headset or on a microSD card or USB
drive, with a place of its own on Home: add one under **Sources › Add
source › Library**, picking the folder or one of the folders offered (your
Videos, Downloads and Movies folders, and each inserted card). Make one for
each kind of video, say Movies in `~/Videos/Movies` and Gaming clips on the
card, and each keeps its own videos. Libraries can't overlap: a folder
inside a library, or holding one, can't be another.

FramePlayerX looks for new and removed videos in a library when you add
it, when FramePlayerX starts, when its card is inserted, each time you open
it, and when you press **Scan now** on its page. Its thumbnails are made in
the background, on one core at low priority, from the video's keyframes,
and wait while a video plays. The pencil next to it under **Sources** renames it or moves
it to another folder, and offers **Rebuild thumbnails** and **Retry**
(videos that couldn't be read).

A library on a card knows the card by its own ID, not by its name or where
it is mounted. Two cards with the same name and the same folders are two
different cards: each video keeps its own thumbnail, rating and resume
point, and a library made on one card shows **Not inserted** while the
other is in. Reformatting a card gives it a new ID: edit the library and
pick its folder again.

### microSD cards and USB drives (VR180 and everything else)

FramePlayerX notices when a card or drive is inserted (a "Found drive"
message appears) and you can browse it under **On this device**. To have
its videos with thumbnails, filters and sorting, make a library of it, or
of a folder on it (see [Libraries](#libraries)).

**Copying videos from a Windows PC or Mac:** format the card as **exFAT**
on the computer (Windows: right-click the card › Format › exFAT), copy the
videos onto it and put it in the Frame. exFAT has no 4 GB file limit, so
8K files are fine; FAT32 cannot hold files over 4 GB.

- The Frame's SteamOS only mounts ext4 cards itself (the kind Steam
  formats for games) and no USB drives. FramePlayerX mounts exFAT, FAT32
  and NTFS cards, and USB drives, itself while it is running, under
  `/run/media/steamos/<name>`.
- Steam may say the card needs formatting. **Don't format it from Steam**:
  that erases the card and makes it ext4, which Windows and macOS can't
  read. FramePlayerX still finds the videos.
- An ext4 card formatted by Steam works too (shared with games: Steam game
  folders, `steamapps`, are skipped), but only the Frame can read it.
- When the card is removed its library's videos stay listed with your
  ratings, resume points and adjustments; they play again once it is back.
- VR180 videos are recognised from their metadata (VR180 cameras, YouTube
  VR180 downloads) or from names like `Trip_VR180.mp4`,
  `Beach_180_LR.mp4` or `clip_180x180_3dh.mp4`. If one shows up wrong, set
  the format once under ⚙ › Format; it is remembered for that file.
- Large high-bitrate 8K files play best from a fast card (A2/V30 or better).

## Video formats

The format is picked automatically from, in order: your own choice for that
file, the file's spherical/stereo metadata, the file name, and the picture's
shape. File-name tags understood include `_180`, `_360`, `_LR`/`_SBS`,
`_TB`/`_OU`/`_HTAB`, `_RL`, `_FISHEYE190`, `_MKX200`, `_MKX220`, `_VRCA220`,
`_EAC`, `_2D`, `_3D`.

Movie shapes (16:9, 4:3, 1.85, scope) and portrait phone clips play on a
flat screen, and full side-by-side or over/under 3D movies (3840x1080,
1920x2160) as flat 3D. A video nothing identifies starts as 180° side by
side; Settings › Playback › **Default format** picks another.

Videos are shown as their file says: a phone clip stored sideways stands
upright, and anamorphic video (DVDs, anamorphic lenses) is widened to its
real shape. A full side-by-side file marked to show at one eye's shape in
2D players (a 1:2 pixel aspect) still shows each eye at its own shape. A
portrait video's screen is as tall as **Screen width**.
When a 3D file's metadata says the right eye comes first, the eyes are
swapped to match.

Around a flat screen, and behind the menus, is a near-black grey.
Settings › Video position › **Background** picks the colour videos start
with: black, grey, navy, or any colour with the red/green/blue sliders.
The same at the bottom of the adjust panel's Position tab changes it for
the video that is playing, and **Save for this video** keeps it with the
rest of its adjustments. Your room replaces it while it shows.

A flat screen's **Distance**, **Width** and **Curvature** are on the adjust
panel's Position tab too. Its size is its width, so zooming a flat screen
with the controller makes it wider or narrower, and **Zoom** shows only for
180°, 360° and fisheye videos.

3D Blu-rays play as full 3D, each eye at full 1080p, on the Frame's
hardware decoder: disc images (`.iso`), MKV rips (MakeMKV), and from a
BDMV folder the film's `.ssif` file in `BDMV/STREAM/SSIF` (the `.m2ts` of
the same name holds the left eye alone). The few streams it can't take
that way (none of the discs tried) play their left eye in 2D; the decoder
line in the video's info says "3D Blu-ray as 2D".

Frame sequential 3D files, whose eyes take turns frame by frame at twice the
film's frame rate, play as full 3D at the film's own rate, each eye at its
full size. They are found by the label in the file, or by `FS3D` in the file
name when a file has none. If depth looks inside out, **Swap eyes** under
the format list corrects it. A file nothing labels can be set to
**3D FS** (frame sequential) in the format list, and a mislabelled one to any other
format.

A disc image, 2D or 3D, plays its main title (its longest playlist) with
its chapters (under **⚙ › Chapters**) and its audio and subtitle languages.
Menus, extras and other titles aren't offered.

To change it: open the video, press **⚙** on the control bar, **Format**.
The format list has a row for each kind of picture (flat screen, 180°,
360°, fisheye and YouTube 360°) and the format playing is lit in it. Its
buttons use the tags VR files carry in their names: 2D, 3D SBS (side by
side), 3D TB (top/bottom), 3D HSBS and 3D HTB (their half-size versions)
and 3D FS (frame sequential); point at one to see its full name.
**Automatic** goes back to the detected format. A choice is remembered for
that video, and a video's details in your library have the same list.
Choosing frame sequential, or leaving it, opens the video again where it
was, since it decodes differently. For a 3D format, **Swap eyes** under the
list shows each eye the other picture, for a file whose depth looks inside
out. The same panel has position, size, IPD/depth, stereo alignment,
picture controls, subtitle depth and keyframes (adjustments that change
smoothly along the video).

Codecs: H.264, HEVC (8/10-bit, HDR10/HLG tone-mapped), AV1, VP9, VP8,
VC-1, MPEG-4, MPEG-2, ProRes. Audio: AAC, AC-3/E-AC-3, Opus, Vorbis, FLAC,
MP3, DTS, TrueHD, PCM (Blu-ray and DVD LPCM too), and spatial (ambisonic)
audio that follows your head.
Subtitles: SRT, ASS/SSA, WebVTT, and embedded text or picture subtitles.

HDR videos (HDR10 and HLG) are fitted to the headset's screen as they play.
Each scene's brightest parts are measured, so midtones keep the brightness
they were graded at and only the highlights are compressed, keeping their
detail. Colours richer than the screen can show are toned down smoothly
instead of being cut off, and the most vivid ones it can show lose a
little saturation to make room for them.

### Presets

A preset keeps everything a video saves, to use on any video: the
format, if you picked one, and the Position, Stereo, Picture and
Passthrough tabs. A flat screen's place, where you moved it, isn't saved
for a video, so a preset leaves it too. Presets sit at the top of the
adjust panel, above the tabs:

- **New preset** saves the playing video's as Preset 1, Preset 2 and so
  on, up to 8. Saved from a video left on **Automatic**, a preset keeps
  no format and leaves each video's to detection.
- Press a preset to give the video all of it at once. It's lit while the
  video has everything of it, and **Save for this video** keeps it with
  the video, as with any change.
- **Edit** lists the presets in place of the tab's page to rename or
  delete them; Delete asks again first. **Done** or any tab goes back.
- While you watch, hold the left grip and press D-pad left for the next
  preset; a message names it. Settings › Controller can move it to another
  button.

Where videos start is set in Settings: **Video position** for the screen,
zoom, height and background, **Picture** for the picture and a 3D video's
depth and eye alignment, and Sound and subtitles for subtitle depth.

### Stereo focus

A 3D 180° or fisheye video is two cameras' pictures, and each eye is
shown its own camera's picture as if everything in it were far away.
That is right while your head is level, faces the front of the picture
and your eyes are as far apart as the camera's lenses. Tilt your head,
lie on your side or turn far round, and the two pictures no longer line
up for your eyes: near things split in two or strain to fuse. Eyes much
wider or narrower than the lenses make depth look shallow or deep.

**Stereo focus**, on the adjust panel's Stereo tab, redraws each eye's
picture for where that eye really is. It is exact at one distance:
whatever is **Focus distance** from the camera stays put and fuses
however you hold your head, and what is much nearer or farther is still
a little off as you tilt or turn. Set it to what you are looking at; a
person in front of a 180° camera is usually 1 to 2 m away, and it starts
at 1.5 m. Looking straight ahead with your head level, it changes
nothing.

**Camera lens spacing** is how far apart the lenses of the camera that
filmed the video were. Most 180° cameras are 60 to 65 mm, and it starts
at 63 mm. Your own eye spacing comes from the headset: the line under it
shows what the headset measures. Both are kept with the video's other
adjustments, and Settings › Picture sets where videos start.

**Automatic** measures how far away what you look at is, from the
video's two pictures, and keeps the focus there as you look round and as
things move, gliding to a new distance about as fast as your eyes turn
in or out. On a headset that tracks your eyes it aims where they look;
**Aims with**, under it, can make it aim with your head instead, the
middle of your view (that choice is kept for all videos, and Settings ›
Picture has it too). Without eye tracking it always aims with your head. It starts from the focus distance set by hand,
and choosing **Manual** keeps the distance where automatic had it. It
changes the distance only when what is round the middle of your view
agrees, so it stays steady at the edge of a face against a far wall. A
skip, a cut or another video starts it afresh, and what it measures is
never saved with the video. A line under it says what it is doing:

- **Measuring…** until it has a first distance.
- **Following** at a distance, and how sure the last measurement was.
  Aimed by your eyes, a second line says so, or that it holds through a
  blink, or that your head aims because your eyes were lost or the eye
  tracker isn't sending.
- **Holding** where it is, and why: nothing to match there (a plain
  wall, darkness), a repeating pattern, the two eyes don't show the same
  thing (something only one camera sees, a reflection), too near the
  edge of the picture, see-through there, or nearer or farther than it
  follows.

**Nearest it follows** (0.5 m to start) and **Farthest it follows**
(20 m, as far as anything) are where it holds instead: raise the nearest
if it jumps to something close, as a pattern repeating on a wall can
make it. **Speed** makes it follow faster or slower than your eyes' own
pace. They are kept with the video like the rest.

It is for 3D 180° and fisheye videos: a 360° video is stitched from more
cameras, and flat 3D has nothing to redraw, so for those its rows are
dimmed. Keyframes glide the focus distance as your eyes would turn in
and out, and change the lens spacing halfway between two.

A thumbstick direction can move the focus distance: in Settings ›
Controller, set one to **Stereo focus distance**. Up is farther, down
nearer, by the same share near or far, and a message shows the
distance. Moving it turns stereo focus on, or from automatic to manual
where automatic was.

### Fisheye lenses

A fisheye format shows **Fisheye lens** under the format list. Its presets
set the field of view: 180°, 190° (the Canon RF 5.2 mm), and 200° and 220°
(the MKX200 and MKX220 that `_MKX200` and `_MKX220` files come from). A
preset is lit only while the field of view is its angle. When the slider
sits on an angle that isn't a preset, a **+** button with that angle adds it
to the presets, up to eight; Settings › Playback › **Fisheye presets**
removes them, and **Reset** there puts the four back. Under them,
**Fisheye starts at** picks the preset a video gets when you pick Fisheye
for it, and a Fisheye default format. It is 180° to begin with; if you
remove the preset it was, the one nearest 180° takes its place. Files
tagged just `_FISHEYE` stay 180°, as the tag means. If the picture still
looks wrong, for example if straight lines bend as you look around or the
eyes stop lining up towards the edges, use the sliders:

- **Field of view**: the lens's angle, 120° to 300°. The image circle fills
  the shorter side of each eye's image.
- **Edge stretch** and **Rim stretch**: for a lens that doesn't spread its
  view evenly. Edge stretch stretches or squeezes the outer part of the
  circle, Rim stretch mostly its very edge.
- **Lens centre**: where each image circle's centre is, if it isn't in the
  middle of its half of the frame. This is common in footage straight from
  a camera. In 3D, each image has its own.

Pull the trigger on a slider's knob and move the pointer to drag it; pulled
elsewhere on the slider, the knob jumps there first. To fine-tune a slider,
point at it and push the thumbstick left or right.
Each push is one step, and holding repeats. **Save for this video** keeps
the settings for that file.

### Subtitles

Subtitles come from inside the video or from files beside it, named after
it: `Movie.srt`, `Movie.en.srt`, `Movie.de.forced.ass`. Jellyfin and Emby
servers offer the subtitle files they keep, and DeoVR feeds and HereSphere
APIs those they list.

Settings › Sound and subtitles › **Subtitles** sets what a video starts with:

- **Automatic** (the default): subtitles in your language when the audio
  is in another one, forced subtitles for the parts in another language
  (signs, a few lines of foreign dialogue), and a subtitle file named
  exactly like the video.
- **Always**: subtitles in your language whenever the video has them.
- **Off**: none.

**Your language** starts as the one Steam is set to. While
a video plays, the pill beside its format on the control bar names the
subtitles showing, and the audio track when there is more than one. Press
it for the audio tracks and subtitles side by side, subtitles in your
language first, each with what tells it apart: forced, SDH, its title or
file name, and its format. Pick one and it plays at once; a long list
scrolls. Press the pill again, or point off the lists and press, to close
it. A video with one audio track, no subtitles and no
[server transcoding](#server-transcoding) has no pill.

What you pick there is kept with the video: it opens with the same audio
track or subtitles next time, while they are still there. Only what you
picked is kept, so a video whose subtitles you never changed follows
**Subtitles** above, even after you change it.

**⚙ › Chapters** lists the video's chapters and your bookmarks (**Bookmark**
on the control bar, or grip + A on the right controller, adds one where you
are), each with a button to go there; grip + X and grip + Y step through
them.

Subtitles show in any script, with the fonts on the headset: Arabic and
Hebrew read right to left, and Chinese, Japanese or Korean need a font
that covers them. If subtitles in a language show nothing or boxes, copy a
font for it (the Noto fonts cover every language) into
`~/.local/share/fonts` and restart FramePlayerX; frameplayerx.log names
the characters it had no font for.

### Videos that stutter: AV1 and 4:2:2

The Frame's hardware decoder plays 4:2:0 HEVC (H.265, 8- and 10-bit) and
H.264 (8-bit), up to 8K. AV1, 4:2:2 or 4:4:4 colour and 10-bit H.264 have
no hardware path on the Frame, so they decode on the CPU, which can't keep
up with VR resolutions: they stutter or stop to buffer, and a warning pill
appears on the control bar. Point at it to read why ("No hardware decoding
for AV1", "… for 4:2:2 HEVC"). Convert them to 4:2:0 HEVC once on a PC and
they play smoothly. VP9 also decodes on the CPU: it keeps up at lower
resolutions, but can stutter at 8K.

"Too big for hardware" means the file can't fit even with nothing else
open: the decoder takes at most 8192×4320 pixels a frame. 8192×4320 and
5760×5760 fit; 6144×6144, 7200×7200, 8192×8192 and larger always decode on
the CPU, so convert them to a smaller size.

"Decoder busy" means the file fits, but other video sessions leave it too
little room. Every session counts, idle or not, recording as well as
playing:

| Other sessions open | Tallest video 8192 wide |
|---|---|
| None | 4320 |
| 1 | 4064 |
| 2 | 2720 |
| 3 | 2016 |

Beside one other session, 8K UHD (7680×4320), 5760×5760 and 8-bit 8192×4096
HEVC still play in hardware; 10-bit 8192×4096 HEVC, 8192×4096 H.264 and
8192×4320 need nothing else open. The warning pill's tip names who holds the
decoder, and the decoder pill's tip also says how much room was left.

Recording in the background in Steam holds a session while an app is
running. When turning it off would make room, the warning pill's tip says so:
choose **Recording Off** in Steam Settings › Game Recording and open the video
again, which works at once.

Steam's browser holds a session after Steam starts, and normally lets go of it
once you start using the headset. If a video stays busy, restart the headset
and open the video again.

"Decoder refused it" means the decoder tried and refused the file;
frameplayerx.log says why. A video whose pictures the hardware decoder
reads as broken, picture after picture, plays in software instead.

The pill next to the format on the control bar says which decoder plays
the video: HW, or SW in amber, with the codec and bit depth. Point at it
to see the decoder, the format and the resolution, and why a video isn't
decoded in hardware.

To check a file: `ffprobe -v error -select_streams v:0 -show_entries
stream=codec_name,profile,pix_fmt video.mp4` (`yuv422p` or `yuv422p10le`
is 4:2:2, `yuv420p10le` is 10-bit), or MediaInfo's *Format*, *Bit depth*
and *Chroma subsampling*. Windows' file properties don't tell these
reliably.

With an NVIDIA graphics card (fast):

```
ffmpeg -hwaccel cuda -i video.mp4 -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a? -c:v hevc_nvenc -preset p5 -profile:v main -pix_fmt yuv420p -rc vbr -cq 20 -b:v 0 -tag:v hvc1 -c:a copy -movflags +faststart video_8bit.mp4
```

Any PC (slower; `-crf` lower is better quality and bigger):

```
ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a? -c:v libx265 -preset fast -crf 20 -profile:v main -pix_fmt yuv420p -tag:v hvc1 -c:a copy -movflags +faststart video_8bit.mp4
```

These make 8-bit HEVC, which always plays in hardware. To keep a 10-bit or
HDR video at 10 bits, use `-profile:v main10` with `-pix_fmt p010le`
(NVIDIA) or `-pix_fmt yuv420p10le` (any PC); it plays in hardware too, but
at 8192×4096 only while nothing else is using the decoder.

Or in HandBrake: the **H.265** encoder for your graphics card (NVEnc, AMD
VCE or Intel QSV; the 10-bit one for a 10-bit or HDR video), Constant
Quality about 20, framerate Same as source, audio Passthru, and
**Dimensions › Cropping: None** (automatic cropping cuts into side-by-side
VR pictures).

Keep the format tags in the name (`_180_LR` and so on); conversions drop
the VR metadata, so a file without tags may need its format set once
under ⚙ › Format.

From a server, a video that stutters can also be transcoded by the server
as it plays, without converting anything: see below.

### Server transcoding

Jellyfin, Emby and Plex can transcode a video live, while it plays, and DeoVR
feeds and HereSphere APIs may offer heights their server transcodes to on
request. Nothing is made ahead of time: the server starts encoding from
the file when FramePlayerX asks, and stops when it stops asking. For those
videos the pill on the control bar starts with the **Quality** playing;
press it for the Quality list beside the audio tracks and subtitles:

- **Automatic** (the default): the file as it is. When the file can't play
  here (a format FramePlayerX has no decoder for, or a picture the hardware
  decoder has no room for), it asks the server to transcode it to the
  tallest height offered and says so on the control bar. It never changes
  the quality while a video plays.
- **Original**: the file as it is, whatever happens.
- A height (**2160p**, **1440p**, …): the server transcodes the file to at
  most that height, the width in proportion, from where you were.

The file always comes first: the server only transcodes when you pick a
height, or under Automatic when the file can't play. The source's maximum
height (edit the source) also caps the heights offered.

Skipping while the server transcodes asks it to start again from there,
which takes a few seconds. A feed's height marked "can't skip" is
transcoded only from the start. Jellyfin, Emby and feeds keep the server's
default audio track and none of the file's own subtitles; subtitle files
still show. While Plex transcodes, the audio and subtitle lists select
the original server tracks and restart from the current position, keeping
the pause state. Selected Plex subtitles are burned into the picture.
Plex uses progressive H.264/AAC video; multipart originals require a
server transcode. Its server must permit transcoding. HLS-only delivery
is not supported.

The server does the work, so how far it can go depends on it: a server
without a graphics card may not keep up with an 8K file, whatever the
size asked. Jellyfin and Emby send H.264, or HEVC when their admin allowed
it (Dashboard › Playback › Transcoding), and pick their own limits:
Jellyfin transcodes to at most 3840 pixels wide, so an 8K 180° video's
2880p and 2160p both come as 3840×1920.

## Display

**Settings › General › Display** sets how the headset draws the picture.
Changes apply at once, also while a video plays.

| Setting | Choices | To begin with |
|---|---|---|
| Refresh rate | 72, 90, 120 Hz | 120 Hz |
| Render resolution | 2160, 3072, 3744 pixels across each eye | 3744 |
| Foveated rendering | Off, Low, High | Low |

- **Refresh rate**: at 120 Hz, 24, 30 and 60 fps videos get even frame
  timing. A lower rate gives each frame more time and saves battery.
- **Render resolution**: the size of the picture drawn for each eye. Above
  the Frame's 2160-pixel panels, 8K video looks sharper and fine detail
  shimmers less. The menus and the control bar look the same at any
  resolution.
- **Foveated rendering**: the picture keeps full detail within 30° of where
  you look (Low) or 18° (High) and less beyond, where your eyes don't see
  detail anyway. It follows your eyes; without eye tracking it stays in the
  middle of each lens. Menus and the pointer always keep full detail.

If a demanding video stutters (8K 10-bit, or a passthrough video with a
mask), set foveation to High or lower the resolution. With foveation off,
8K 10-bit video needs a lower resolution or refresh rate to play smoothly.

### Eye tracking

On a headset that tracks your eyes, **Settings › General › Eye
tracking** says whether the tracker is sending where you look. If it
isn't, check that eye tracking is on, and allowed for apps, in the
headset's settings. **Gaze dot** shows a small dot where your eyes look,
inside a thin ring about as wide as the tracker's error, so you can see
how close it gets. The dot hides while you blink or the tracker loses
your eyes. With stereo focus on it sits at the distance in focus, so
your eyes meet on it where the picture is right; otherwise 2 m away.

An eye tracker is often a few degrees off for a given person, which the
dot makes plain. **Gaze check** corrects it: press **Start**, and the
panels make way for five dots, one at a time, for about 8 seconds: in
the middle, then above, below, left and right of it. Look at each until
the next shows; the dots move with your head, so turning it doesn't
matter. A line then says how far off your gaze was before and after,
and the correction is kept for the dot and for automatic focus until you
press **Reset**. Foveated rendering keeps the tracker's own gaze. If the tracker stops sending, your
eyes are lost too often, or they don't seem to follow the dots, it says
so and keeps nothing; **Back** stops a check.

## Controls

Each button does one thing: the right hand runs playback, the left hand the
picture. Play/pause and seeking are under either thumb.

| Control | Right hand | Left hand |
|---|---|---|
| Thumbstick left / right | Seek back / forward 10 s (adjustable; hold to repeat). Pointing at a list: previous / next page. Pointing at a slider: one fine step | The same |
| Thumbstick up / down | Volume (or scroll a menu you point at) | Tilt the picture (or scroll a menu you point at) |
| Thumbstick press | Mute | Reset the picture |
| A / D-pad down | Play / pause | Play / pause |
| B / D-pad right | Back: closes the open panel, then shows the browse panel over the video, then returns to the video | Your room on / off: around flat videos and the panels, or through a side-by-side passthrough video's mask |
| X / D-pad left | Previous video in the list you opened it from | Adjust panel |
| Y / D-pad up | Next video | Show or hide the controls |
| Menu / View | Browse | Recenter |
| Bumper | Forward 1 minute | Back 1 minute |
| Grip + thumbstick | Up / down raises or lowers you | Left / right turns the picture, down zooms in, up zooms out |
| Grip + X / Y | Previous / next chapter or bookmark (back within 3 s of one's start goes to the one before) | Grip + D-pad left: the next [preset](#presets); D-pad up as without the grip |
| Grip + A | Bookmark where you are | As without the grip |
| Grip + thumbstick press | Subtitles off, or back on: the ones you had, else those in your language | As without the grip |
| Hold grip + trigger, move | Drag the picture (a flat screen or the dome follows your hand) | The same |
| Trigger | Click; on empty space, show or hide the controls | The same |

On the control bar, point at the speaker for the volume slider above it;
press the speaker to mute. What a controller shortcut changes, such as the
volume or a minute's skip, shows for a moment in a small message above where
the control bar sits.

To recenter, hold the Steam button, as in any game (both grips together, or
the left Menu button, do it too). The picture and the panels come to where
you are looking; looking well up or down (lying back, say) counts, a glance
a little up or down doesn't, so sitting up a flat screen comes back level.
The browse panel (upright, a little below where you look) and a flat screen
come back in front of you, wherever you had moved them (a 180° or 360°
picture keeps its turn). A flat screen opens upright at eye height, the way
the browse panel faces: where you move it lasts while you watch, and isn't
kept with the video. Only the control bar is tilted back towards you.

Each piece moves on its own and takes what hangs off it along. Drag the
picture (grip + trigger) or use Yaw and Pitch to move a flat screen: the
control bar and the adjust panel go with it. Hold grip on the control bar
to move it about the screen: the adjust panel goes with it. Hold grip on
the adjust panel to move it about the bar. During a 180° or 360° video,
Yaw, Pitch and dragging turn only the picture; the control bar and adjust
panel stay where they are. The browse panel (or the keyboard under it)
moves the same way, with grip, and stays where you leave it. To put them all back where they start, press **Put back** at the top
of the adjust panel's Position tab: a flat screen, the control bar, the
adjust panel and the browse panel return (a 180° or 360° picture keeps
its turn; the panel's **Reset** puts the picture's own adjustments back). The format on the control bar
(for example 180° 3D) opens the adjust panel's Format tab.

### Watching lying down

Lie back, look where you want the picture, and hold the Steam button to
recenter: it comes up to where you look. Or turn on **Screen follows you**
(the bed button on the control bar, or Settings › General): a flat video
and the menus then follow your head and stay in front of you as you turn,
lie back or roll onto your side. 180° and 360° videos don't follow, since
you look around those. For a 3D 180° or fisheye video, turn on
[Stereo focus](#stereo-focus) so lying on your side doesn't split it in two.

Every button and thumbstick direction above can be changed in Settings ›
Controller: point at a button, pull the trigger and pick an action.
**Grip + press** above the controllers shows what each does with that
controller's grip held, and changes it there; one left at **Same as press**
does what it does without the grip. **Reset to defaults** puts this layout
back. For example, to zoom with the right thumbstick, set the right controller's
thumbstick **↑↓ Up / down** (or **Grip + ↑↓**) to Zoom. The trigger,
grip + trigger drags, both grips, menu paging and slider steps are fixed.

Drags, turns, tilts and zoom count as adjustments: save them for that video
under ⚙, or press the left thumbstick to undo them.

Text fields bring up a keyboard below the panel you type in; **#+=**
switches it to symbols (`! # $ % ( ) [ ] { }` and the rest) and **abc** back. You can also
type on your phone through the web remote.

## Passthrough videos

The adjust panel's **Passthrough** tab (the sliders button on the control
bar, then the glasses tab) makes part of a video see-through so your room
shows behind it. The **Room** button (the armchair) on the bar shows your
room around a flat video's screen; on a side-by-side 180° or fisheye
video it turns the video's own mask on and off.

### Videos with their own mask (`_alpha`)

Many passthrough videos carry a see-through mask inside the
picture, and their names end in `_alpha` (for example
`Scene_4096p_FISHEYE190_alpha.mp4`). FramePlayerX reads the mask by itself:
only the people stay and the room shows around them, with nothing to set.
For a file whose name doesn't say so (renamed, or named by a server), press
**Room** on the control bar, or turn on **Use the video's mask** in the
Passthrough tab; either is remembered for that file. Only side-by-side
videos can carry a mask.

### Green and blue screens (chroma key)

Videos filmed against a green or blue screen can show your room instead of
the screen: turn on **Remove the background**.

For a video without its own mask and with no Passthrough settings of its
own yet, the colour to remove is found in the video itself, usually a
second or two after it starts playing. It comes from a frame in the middle of the video,
so a studio's intro doesn't decide it, and is used at full strength like
the one-tap colours. The Colour row then says "Found in this video". Until
then, or if no screen colour is found in that frame, the colour from
**Settings > Passthrough** is used.

To use another colour, pick green screen, blue screen or magenta, or set one
with the red/green/blue sliders; that replaces the found one.
**Similarity** sets how close a colour must be to disappear, **Edge softness**
feathers the cut, and **Spill removal** takes the screen's tint off hair and
edges. A keyed video turns passthrough on by itself, whatever its format.

**Settings > Passthrough** sets this for every video. To change one video,
open the adjust panel's **Passthrough** tab while it plays: changing anything
there gives that video its own settings (save them like any other
adjustment), and turning **Own settings for this video** off makes it follow
Settings again.

## Haptics

Haptics are off until you turn on **Settings › General › Haptic devices**.
Until then FramePlayerX shows nothing about them and loads no scripts.

Scripts (`.funscript`, including multi-axis `video.surge.funscript` etc.)
are found next to the video, in `~/.local/share/frameplayerx/Interactive`
(Settings › Haptics shows it), or supplied by the server.
Add a device in **Settings › Haptics**: Intiface Central, TCode devices
(OSR2/SR6 over USB serial, TCP or UDP), or The Handy (connection key). The
seek bar shows the script's intensity.

## Remote control

With **Settings › Remote control › Phone and browser remote** on, your
phone controls the video playing in the headset: play and pause, skipping,
seeking (the bar splits at chapters and bookmarks), previous and next in Up
next, volume and mute, audio and subtitles, speed, Recenter and closing the
video. **Up next** lists what plays in turn (tap one to play it), with its
**Loop**; **Loop video** and **Autoplay** are the switches beside it, the
same ones as on the headset. The field at the bottom types into the headset,
into whichever field is open there. To pair a phone,
open the address that tab shows (such as `192.168.1.20:8790`) in the phone's
browser and enter the 6-digit code under it; the phone stays paired. A code
pairs one phone, and stops working ten minutes after the tab last showed it.
After five wrong codes pairing stops until you press **New pairing code**.
**Unpair all phones** makes every paired phone pair again.

The **DeoVR remote API** (port 23554) works with apps that speak DeoVR's
protocol, without pairing. Both only answer devices on your local network.
The phone's page is in the headset's language, and changes with it.

## Language

FramePlayerX comes in English, German, Spanish, French, Japanese and
Simplified Chinese. **Settings › General › Language** starts on
**Automatic**, which follows the language Steam is set to (English when
Steam's isn't one of these); choose one to keep it whatever Steam's is.
Server names, titles and other text from your servers show as they come.

The translations started as machine drafts. If one reads wrong, the
[README](../README.md#help-translate) says how to correct it or report it.

## Troubleshooting

- When a video stutters, turn on Settings › General › **Performance
  overlay**. It starts to your left. Squeeze a grip on it to move it, and it
  stays where you leave it, next time too. Amber marks trouble.
  - **Display**: frames drawn against the display's rate, and how long the
    app's work on each one typically takes. Low means the headset can't draw
    fast enough.
  - **Video**: frames shown against the film's own rate, and frames dropped
    and stalls since it opened.
  - **Decoder**: hardware or software, and the format.
  - **Buffer**: seconds of video read ahead, against how many it's aiming for.
    Falling means the source isn't keeping up.
  - **Network**: how fast data is arriving, and how many requests have failed.
    With a full buffer it only reads what the film uses, or nothing, so that
    isn't your connection's limit.
  - **Last skip**: how long the last skip took to show a picture, and how long
    its first read of the file took. It says **Opened** until you skip.
  - **CPU** and **GPU**: how busy and how hot they are, amber when the headset
    is slowing them for heat, and the GPU's clock.
  - **Memory**: how much is in use.

  Without a video open, it shows only Display, CPU, GPU and Memory.
- After a crash, the next start asks whether to send a crash report to
  FramePlayerX's developers, as a private issue on GitHub. It contains the
  versions of FramePlayerX and the headset's system, what went wrong, and
  the log of that session with the names of your videos, files and folders,
  your servers' addresses and any password replaced by placeholders such as
  `<video 1>`. **Show the report** shows exactly what would be sent;
  nothing is sent unless you choose **Send report**.
- To report a problem yourself, **Settings › About** links to FramePlayerX's
  GitHub page, its issue form (choose Bug report and attach the log below)
  and its GitHub Sponsors page. A link opens in Steam's browser; the
  address beside it works on a phone or a computer too.
- Log: `~/.local/share/frameplayerx/frameplayerx.log`; the run before is kept
  as `frameplayerx.log.old` (the one to send after a freeze or crash, once
  FramePlayerX has been started again)
- Settings: `~/.config/frameplayerx/settings.json` (delete to reset)
- Network source passwords: `~/.config/frameplayerx/sources.json`
  (readable only by you)
- "Is SteamVR running?": FramePlayerX needs the headset's OpenXR runtime;
  start it from the Steam library, not a desktop terminal.
- "… has signed this headset out": a Jellyfin server ends a Quick
  Connect sign-in when the account's password changes or the device is
  signed out on the server. Pair again: the pencil next to the source under
  **Sources**, *Clear* next to Quick Connect, then *Get pairing code*.
