# FramePlayerX user guide

FramePlayerX plays flat, 180°, 360°, fisheye and YouTube-style (EAC) videos,
2D or 3D, on the Steam Frame, from the headset, a microSD card, a USB drive
or your network.

## Install

**On the headset, in Desktop Mode (no PC).** Open this page in the
headset's browser and press the button to download the installer:

<a href="https://github.com/remotesojourner/frameplayerx/releases/latest/download/Install-FramePlayerX.desktop"><img src="../assets/install-button.svg" alt="Install in Desktop Mode" width="240" /></a>

Open `Install-FramePlayerX.desktop` from your Downloads folder and confirm
when Desktop Mode asks whether to trust it. A terminal window opens and:

- downloads the latest stable release and checks it against the checksum
  GitHub recorded for it;
- removes other copies of FramePlayerX and their library entries (your
  settings and watch history stay);
- installs it into `~/frameplayerx` and adds **FramePlayerX** to the Steam
  library with its artwork.

If Steam can't be updated while it's running, the installer asks to close
it; the app then appears when you return to Gaming Mode, which it offers to
do. Run the same file again to reinstall. From a terminal, the installer
also takes `--beta` (the newest release, betas included); see
[tools/frame-desktop-install](../tools/frame-desktop-install/README.md).

The other two ways need **Developer Mode** on, and the headset paired once
with your PC by `frameplayerx-install pair` (below), Frame Control,
FrameDrop or Valve's SteamOS Devkit Client.

**With FrameDrop or Frame Control, from a PC.** With the app running on
your PC and the headset paired, press the button in your PC's browser:

<a href="https://framedropvr.com/install?manifest=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fremotesojourner%2Fframeplayerx%2Freleases%2Flatest%2Fdownload%2Fframedrop.json"><img src="../assets/framedrop-button.svg" alt="Install with FrameDrop" width="240" /></a>
<a href="https://remotesojourner.github.io/frameplayerx/frame-control.html"><img src="../assets/frame-control-button.svg" alt="Install with Frame Control" width="240" /></a>

GitHub doesn't keep links that open apps, so the Frame Control button opens a
small page that opens Frame Control. If that doesn't work, paste this link
into the browser's address bar instead:

```
frame-control://install?manifest=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fremotesojourner%2Fframeplayerx%2Freleases%2Flatest%2Fdownload%2Fframeplayerx.json
```

Either app reads the release's manifest (`framedrop.json` or
`frameplayerx.json`), downloads the latest release, checks its SHA-256 and
unpacks it into `~/frameplayerx`.

**From a PC with the installer.** Download `frameplayerx-install` for your
PC from the release page and run it:

```
frameplayerx-install pair 192.168.0.68       # once: the headset's IP address
frameplayerx-install                         # latest release
frameplayerx-install --zip frameplayerx-0.1.0-aarch64.zip
frameplayerx-install status | uninstall
```

To pair, open Steam Settings › Developer › Pair new host on the headset
and keep that screen showing while `pair` runs. It creates an RSA key
(`~/.ssh/id_rsa_frame_devkit`; the headset does not accept ed25519 keys),
registers it with the headset and adds a `Host frame` entry to
`~/.ssh/config`. If you skip this step, `frameplayerx-install` offers to
pair when it cannot log in.

It reuses the `frame` SSH alias created when pairing, installs into
`~/frameplayerx` (keeping the previous version as `~/frameplayerx.old`) and
adds **FramePlayerX** to the Steam library with artwork. Add
`--restart-steam` to make it show up right away.

**By hand.** Copy the zip to the headset, unzip it into your home folder
and add `~/frameplayerx/frameplayerx.sh` to Steam as a non-Steam game.

## Updating

FramePlayerX checks for a new version each time it starts, but doesn't
install it by itself. To update, open **Settings › Updates**: when a new
version is out it's listed there with what changed. Press **Download and
install**, then **Quit now** and start FramePlayerX again. **Check now**
looks again without restarting.

The **Stable** channel gets finished releases only; **Beta** also gets
test versions before they are released. Switch off **Check for updates at
start** to only check when you press **Check now**. Installing again with
any of the ways above also updates it.

## Uninstall

Uninstalling removes the app, its entry in the Steam library and its
library artwork. You choose whether your settings, source passwords, watch
history and thumbnails go too; kept, a later install picks up where you
left off. Your videos are never touched.

**On the headset, in Desktop Mode (no PC).** Open this page in the
headset's browser and press the button to download the uninstaller:

<a href="https://github.com/remotesojourner/frameplayerx/releases/latest/download/Uninstall-FramePlayerX.desktop"><img src="../assets/uninstall-button.svg" alt="Uninstall in Desktop Mode" width="240" /></a>

Open `Uninstall-FramePlayerX.desktop` from your Downloads folder and
confirm when Desktop Mode asks whether to trust it. A terminal window
opens, asks you to confirm, removes FramePlayerX, then asks whether to
delete your settings and watch history too. If it closes Steam, the entry
is gone when you return to Gaming Mode, which it offers to do.

From Konsole, the same installer's `--remove` does this, and
`--remove --purge` deletes your settings and watch history without asking:

```
curl -fsSL https://github.com/remotesojourner/frameplayerx/releases/latest/download/frameplayerx-desktop-install.py -o /tmp/frameplayerx-desktop-install.py
python3 /tmp/frameplayerx-desktop-install.py --remove
```

**From a PC.** With the headset still paired (Developer Mode on):

```
frameplayerx-install uninstall                  # keeps your settings and watch history
frameplayerx-install uninstall --purge          # deletes them too
```

Add `--restart-steam` so the library updates right away.

**Installed with Frame Control or FrameDrop.** They install into the same
folder, `~/frameplayerx`, so either way above removes it.

**By hand.** Delete the `frameplayerx` and `frameplayerx.old` folders in
your home folder, and remove FramePlayerX from the Steam library.

**Deleting your settings and watch history later.** If you kept them, or
removed the app by hand, they stay behind. To delete them, run this in
Konsole on the headset:

```
rm -rf ~/.config/frameplayerx ~/.local/share/frameplayerx ~/.cache/frameplayerx
```

| Folder | What's in it |
|---|---|
| `~/.config/frameplayerx` | Settings, your sources and their passwords |
| `~/.local/share/frameplayerx` | The watch history, ratings, adjustments, the log, and the `Interactive` folder, including any haptic scripts you put there |
| `~/.cache/frameplayerx` | Thumbnails |

If you paired a PC with `frameplayerx-install pair` and nothing else uses
that pairing, you can also delete `~/.ssh/id_rsa_frame_devkit` and
`~/.ssh/id_rsa_frame_devkit.pub` on the PC, and the `Host frame` entry in
`~/.ssh/config`.

## Where your videos can be

| Where | How |
|---|---|
| `~/Videos`, `~/Downloads` | Found automatically (Home › On this device) |
| microSD card / USB drive (exFAT from a PC, or ext4) | Found automatically when inserted (Settings › On this device) |
| Other folders on the headset | Settings › On this device › Add folder |
| Any server with a DeoVR feed or HereSphere API | Sources › Add source › DeoVR feed or HereSphere API |
| NAS / Windows share | Sources › Add source › SMB share (`smb://nas/videos`) |
| Nextcloud and other WebDAV | Sources › Add source › WebDAV |
| Jellyfin, Emby | Sources › Add source › Jellyfin / Emby (Quick Connect or password) |
| Plex, Serviio and other DLNA servers | Sources › Add source › DLNA › Search the network |
| A web server folder listing | Sources › Add source › HTTP |

### Home, watch history and browsing

**Home** opens on what you were watching (a banner to resume, then
*Continue watching* and *Favorites*) and ends with a row of your sources:
**On this device** first, then every source you added, then *Add a source*.
Each opens in a browser made for that kind of source; Back returns to Home.
Its title is always the source's name, with where you are in it underneath.
Sources locked with a PIN stay off Home until unlocked; the padlock on a
tile locks it (or, without a PIN yet, asks for one).

**Watch history** lists everything you have played, from any source, with
the same search, format filters and orders (recently watched, title, most
watched, rating, length). Remove one video with ⋯ › *Remove from history*,
or everything with *Clear history*; favorites and ratings stay. Browsing a
network source never adds anything here. Removing a source forgets its
videos, except those you watched or marked.

| Source | What browsing it offers |
|---|---|
| On this device | **Videos**: everything found on the headset, its cards and drives, with search, format filters and sorting. **Folders**: the home folder and the drives as folders |
| Jellyfin / Emby | Your libraries, *Continue watching*, *Next up* and the latest additions; a search of the whole server by title, as Jellyfin's own search shows it: a row each of movies, shows, collections and other videos, best matches first (episodes are found through their show); poster grids searched, sorted and filtered by the server (unwatched, in progress, favorites); series by season and episode; details with the story, cast and genres. Watched marks, favorites and resume points are the server's (see [Watch sync](#watch-sync-with-jellyfin-emby-and-heresphere)) |
| DeoVR feed / HereSphere API | The server's scene groups as chips over a grid of scenes; search the chosen group (or *All*) across titles, studios, performers and tags; order by title, date, rating or length; a *Favorites* filter (and *Scripted*, with haptics on). ⋯ opens a scene's details: description, performers and tags (tap one to see all their scenes), chapters to start from, and ♡ to make it a favourite on a HereSphere API that takes favourites. The page opens with the scenes from last time while the server sends the current list ("updating…" under the title). A HereSphere API can also follow what you watch (see [Watch sync](#watch-sync-with-jellyfin-emby-and-heresphere)) |
| SMB, WebDAV, HTTP folders, DLNA, local folders | Folders and files: search the folder you are in, order by name, date or size, *Play all* |

### Locking a source with a PIN

To keep a share or folder private when someone else uses the headset, press
the padlock next to it under **Sources** (or on its tile on Home) and choose
a PIN (4 to 8 digits). While it is locked it can't be browsed, it is left
off Home, and its videos are left out of the watch history, search and the
phone remote; opening one asks for the PIN. **Unlock** opens it until
FramePlayerX restarts; one press of the padlock locks it again. To change
the PIN or remove it, edit the source (the pencil under **Sources**).
Removing the source also removes its PIN. This keeps guests out, it doesn't
encrypt anything: the files themselves stay as they are.

### Editing a source

The pencil next to a source under **Sources** opens its details: rename it,
change its address, user name and password, or its PIN. Its type stays; a
Jellyfin or Emby server signed in with Quick Connect keeps that sign-in
unless you clear it.

To lock one folder of a NAS, add that folder as its own source
(`smb://nas/videos/private`) and lock it. Everything in it is then hidden
everywhere, also when browsing a source for the whole share, and from the
watch history even if it was played through that source.

### Watch sync with Jellyfin, Emby and HereSphere

These servers keep track of what you watch, and FramePlayerX keeps them in
step with the headset:

- **Jellyfin and Emby** hear when a video starts, pauses, resumes, jumps or
  changes speed, where it is every 10 seconds, and where it stopped. The
  server keeps the resume point, counts the play and marks the video
  watched when you stop near the end; its dashboard shows it playing on the
  headset. A video starts at the server's resume point, also when opened
  from Watch history or Home, so you can carry on where you left off on
  another device. ♡ and ✓ *Watched* on a Jellyfin page change the marks on
  the server at once.
- **HereSphere APIs** that ask for playback events get the ones HereSphere
  itself sends (open, play, pause and close, with the position), from which
  the server counts plays and keeps resume points. ♡ on a scene's page
  makes it a favourite on a server that takes favourites.

Reports go out in the background and in order. Quitting waits a few
seconds for the last ones; one the server doesn't take (it is offline, or
the sign-in expired) is noted in frameplayerx.log and not sent again.

DeoVR feeds, DLNA, network shares and folders keep no watch state on the
server: their resume points, favorites and ratings stay on the headset.

### microSD cards and USB drives (VR180 and everything else)

FramePlayerX notices when a card or drive is inserted (a "Found drive"
message appears), adds its videos to **On this device** and makes
thumbnails. You can also browse it as folders under **On this device ›
Folders**.

**Copying videos from a Windows PC or Mac:** format the card as **exFAT**
on the computer (Windows: right-click the card › Format › exFAT), copy the
videos onto it and put it in the Frame. exFAT has no 4 GB file limit, so
8K files are fine; FAT32 cannot hold files over 4 GB.

- The Frame's SteamOS only mounts ext4 cards itself (the kind Steam
  formats for games) and no USB drives. FramePlayerX mounts exFAT, FAT32
  and NTFS cards, and USB drives, itself while it is running, under
  `/run/media/steamos/<name>`.
- Steam may say the card needs formatting. **Don't format it from Steam**:
  that erases the card and makes it ext4, which Windows and macOS can't
  read. FramePlayerX still finds the videos.
- An ext4 card formatted by Steam works too (shared with games: Steam game
  folders, `steamapps`, are skipped), but only the Frame can read it.
- When the card is removed its videos stay listed with your
  ratings, resume points and adjustments; they play again once it is back.
- VR180 videos are recognised from their metadata (VR180 cameras, YouTube
  VR180 downloads) or from names like `Trip_VR180.mp4`,
  `Beach_180_LR.mp4` or `clip_180x180_3dh.mp4`. If one shows up wrong, set
  the format once under ⚙ › Format; it is remembered for that file.
- Large high-bitrate 8K files play best from a fast card (A2/V30 or better).

## Video formats

The format is picked automatically from, in order: your own choice for that
file, the file's spherical/stereo metadata, the file name, and the picture's
shape. File-name tags understood include `_180`, `_360`, `_LR`/`_SBS`,
`_TB`/`_OU`, `_RL`, `_FISHEYE190`, `_MKX200`, `_MKX220`, `_VRCA220`,
`_EAC`, `_2D`, `_3D`.

Movie shapes (16:9, 4:3, 1.85, scope) play on a flat screen, and full
side-by-side or over/under 3D movies (3840x1080, 1920x2160) as flat 3D. A
video nothing identifies starts as 180° side by side; Settings › Playback ›
**Default format** picks another.

To change it: open the video, press **⚙** on the control bar, **Format**.
Overrides are remembered per video. The same panel has position, zoom,
IPD/depth, stereo alignment, picture controls, subtitle depth and
keyframes (adjustments that change smoothly along the video).

### A cinema for flat videos

Flat videos play on a screen in the dark. Set **Environment** to **Cinema**
(Settings › Playback › Flat videos, or ⚙ › Format › Screen while one plays)
and the screen hangs in a cinema hall instead: curtains beside it, rows of
seats stepping down towards it, and walls, seats and floor lit by the
picture. The house lights come up while the video is paused. The hall
grows with the screen's width and distance, and your room shows instead
while passthrough is on.

Codecs: H.264, HEVC (8/10-bit, HDR10/HLG tone-mapped), AV1, VP9, VP8,
VC-1, MPEG-4, MPEG-2, ProRes. Audio: AAC, AC-3/E-AC-3, Opus, Vorbis, FLAC,
MP3, DTS, TrueHD, PCM (Blu-ray and DVD LPCM too), and spatial (ambisonic)
audio that follows your head.
Subtitles: SRT, ASS/SSA, WebVTT, and embedded text or picture subtitles.

### Subtitles

Subtitles come from inside the video or from files beside it, named after
it: `Movie.srt`, `Movie.en.srt`, `Movie.de.forced.ass`. Jellyfin and Emby
servers offer the subtitle files they keep, and DeoVR feeds and HereSphere
APIs those they list.

Settings › Playback › **Subtitles** sets what a video starts with:

- **Automatic** (the default): subtitles in your language when the audio
  is in another one, forced subtitles for the parts in another language
  (signs, a few lines of foreign dialogue), and a subtitle file named
  exactly like the video.
- **Always**: subtitles in your language whenever the video has them.
- **Off**: none.

**Your language** starts as the system's (English when it has none). While
a video plays, **⚙** › **Audio & subs** lists its subtitles, those in your
language first, each with what tells it apart: forced, SDH, its title or
file name, and its format. A video with many keeps those in other
languages under **Other languages**.

Subtitles show in any script, with the fonts on the headset: Arabic and
Hebrew read right to left, and Chinese, Japanese or Korean need a font
that covers them. If subtitles in a language show nothing or boxes, copy a
font for it (the Noto fonts cover every language) into
`~/.local/share/fonts` and restart FramePlayerX; frameplayerx.log names
the characters it had no font for.

### Videos that stutter: 10-bit HEVC and AV1

The Frame's hardware decoder plays 8-bit 4:2:0 H.264 and HEVC (H.265), up
to 8K. 10-bit HEVC, 4:2:2 or 4:4:4 colour and AV1 have no hardware path on
the Frame, so they decode on the CPU, which can't keep up with VR
resolutions: they stutter or stop to buffer, and the control bar says why
("No hardware decoding for 10-bit HEVC", "… for 4:2:2 HEVC"). Convert them
to 8-bit 4:2:0 HEVC once on a PC and they play smoothly.

"Hardware decoder busy" means the file is fine but the decoder had no room
for it (Steam's own streaming uses it too). "The hardware decoder can't
play this HEVC" means it tried and refused the file; frameplayerx.log says
why.

The pill next to the format on the control bar says which decoder plays
the video: HW, or SW in amber, with the codec and bit depth. Hover it, or
open Adjust → Format → Video stream, to see why a video isn't decoded in
hardware.

To check a file: `ffprobe -v error -select_streams v:0 -show_entries
stream=codec_name,profile,pix_fmt video.mp4` (`Main 10` / `yuv420p10le`
is 10-bit, `yuv422p` is 4:2:2), or MediaInfo's *Bit depth* and *Chroma
subsampling*. Windows' file properties don't tell these reliably.

With an NVIDIA graphics card (fast):

```
ffmpeg -hwaccel cuda -i video.mp4 -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a? -c:v hevc_nvenc -preset p5 -profile:v main -pix_fmt yuv420p -rc vbr -cq 20 -b:v 0 -tag:v hvc1 -c:a copy -movflags +faststart video_8bit.mp4
```

Any PC (slower; `-crf` lower is better quality and bigger):

```
ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a? -c:v libx265 -preset fast -crf 20 -profile:v main -pix_fmt yuv420p -tag:v hvc1 -c:a copy -movflags +faststart video_8bit.mp4
```

Or in HandBrake: the **H.265** encoder for your graphics card (NVEnc, AMD
VCE or Intel QSV, not one marked 10-bit), Constant Quality about 20,
framerate Same as source, audio Passthru, and **Dimensions › Cropping:
None** (automatic cropping cuts into side-by-side VR pictures).

Keep the format tags in the name (`_180_LR` and so on); conversions drop
the VR metadata, so a file without tags may need its format set once
under ⚙ › Format.

## Controls

Each button does one thing: the right hand runs playback, the left hand the
picture. Play/pause and seeking are under either thumb.

| Control | Right hand | Left hand |
|---|---|---|
| Thumbstick left / right | Seek back / forward 10 s (adjustable; hold to repeat). Pointing at a list: previous / next page | The same |
| Thumbstick up / down | Volume (or scroll a menu you point at) | Tilt the picture (or scroll a menu you point at) |
| Thumbstick press | Mute | Reset the picture |
| A / D-pad down | Play / pause | Play / pause |
| B / D-pad right | Back: closes the open panel, then shows the library over the video, then returns to the video | Your room on / off: around flat videos and the library, or through a side-by-side passthrough video's mask |
| X / D-pad left | Previous video in the list you opened it from | Adjust panel |
| Y / D-pad up | Next video | Show or hide the controls |
| Menu / View | Library | Recenter |
| Bumper | Forward 1 minute | Back 1 minute |
| Grip + thumbstick | Up / down raises or lowers you | Left / right turns the picture, up / down zooms in / out |
| Hold grip + trigger, move | Drag the picture (the dome follows your hand) | The same |
| Trigger | Click; on empty space, show or hide the controls | The same |

Both grips together also recenter. Point at the library or adjust panel (or
the keyboard under it) and hold grip to move it; it stays where you leave
it. Recentering brings them back in front of you, at the height you left
them. The format on the control bar (for example 180° SBS) opens the adjust
panel's Format tab.

Every button and thumbstick direction above can be changed in Settings ›
Controller (tap a row, pick an action; Reset to defaults puts this layout
back). For example, to zoom with the right thumbstick, set the right controller's
thumbstick **↑↓ Up / down** (or **Grip + ↑↓**) to Zoom. The trigger,
grip + trigger drags, both grips and menu paging are fixed.

Drags, turns, tilts and zoom count as adjustments: save them for that video
under ⚙, or press the left thumbstick to undo them.

Text fields bring up a keyboard below the panel you type in; **#+=**
switches it to symbols (`! # $ % ( ) [ ] { }` and the rest) and **abc** back. You can also
type on your phone through the web remote.

## Passthrough videos

The adjust panel's **Passthrough** tab (the sliders button on the control
bar, then the glasses tab) makes part of a video see-through so your room
shows behind it. The **Room** button (the armchair) on the bar shows your
room around a flat video's screen; on a side-by-side 180° or fisheye
video it turns the video's own mask on and off.

### Videos with their own mask (`_alpha`)

Many passthrough videos carry a see-through mask inside the
picture, and their names end in `_alpha` (for example
`Scene_4096p_FISHEYE190_alpha.mp4`). FramePlayerX reads the mask by itself:
only the people stay and the room shows around them, with nothing to set.
For a file whose name doesn't say so (renamed, or named by a server), press
**Room** on the control bar, or turn on **Use the video's mask** in the
Passthrough tab; either is remembered for that file. Only side-by-side
videos can carry a mask.

### Green and blue screens (chroma key)

Videos filmed against a green or blue screen can show your room instead of
the screen. Turn on **Remove the background** and pick the colour (green
screen, blue screen, or any colour with the red/green/blue sliders).
**Similarity** sets how close a colour must be to disappear, **Edge softness**
feathers the cut, and **Spill removal** takes the screen's tint off hair and
edges. A keyed video turns passthrough on by itself, whatever its format.

**Settings > Passthrough** sets this for every video. To change one video,
open the adjust panel's **Passthrough** tab while it plays: changing anything
there gives that video its own settings (save them like any other
adjustment), and turning **Own settings for this video** off makes it follow
Settings again.
## Haptics

Haptics are off until you turn on **Settings › Playback › Haptic devices**.
Until then FramePlayerX shows nothing about them and loads no scripts.

Scripts (`.funscript`, including multi-axis `video.surge.funscript` etc.)
are found next to the video, in `~/.local/share/frameplayerx/Interactive`
(Settings › On this device shows it), or supplied by the server.
Add a device in **Settings › Haptics**: Intiface Central, TCode devices
(OSR2/SR6 over USB serial, TCP or UDP), or The Handy (connection key). The
seek bar shows the script's intensity.

## Remote control

**Settings › Remote control › Phone / browser remote** shows a QR code; scan
it to control playback, browse the library and type from your phone. The
**DeoVR remote API** (port 23554) works with apps that speak DeoVR's
protocol. Both only answer devices on your local network.

## Troubleshooting

- Log: `~/.local/share/frameplayerx/frameplayerx.log`; the run before is kept
  as `frameplayerx.log.old` (the one to send after a freeze or crash, once
  FramePlayerX has been started again)
- Settings: `~/.config/frameplayerx/settings.json` (delete to reset)
- Network source passwords: `~/.config/frameplayerx/sources.json`
  (readable only by you)
- "Is SteamVR running?": FramePlayerX needs the headset's OpenXR runtime;
  start it from the Steam library, not a desktop terminal.
- "… has signed this headset out": a Jellyfin or Emby server ends a Quick
  Connect sign-in when the account's password changes or the device is
  signed out on the server. Pair again: the pencil next to the source under
  **Sources**, *Clear* next to Quick Connect, then *Get pairing code*.
