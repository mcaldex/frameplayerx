# Developing FramePlayerX

How to build, test and release FramePlayerX, and how the code fits
together. For using the app, see the [user guide](USER-GUIDE.md).

## Requirements

- **Linux** (Ubuntu or Debian), or **Windows with Ubuntu under WSL2**. The
  workspace doesn't build on Windows itself.
- Rust through rustup, which installs the version in `rust-toolchain.toml`
  (the one CI uses) with clippy, rustfmt and the ARM64 target.
- The tools in `tools/requirements.txt`, from a virtualenv (the file says
  how): zig and cargo-zigbuild for builds for the Frame, meson for FFmpeg
  (Ubuntu's 1.3 can't use zig's linker), and git-cliff for releases.
- For FFmpeg: ninja, nasm and pkg-config.

On Ubuntu, `tools/local-xr.sh setup` installs Monado and the tools FFmpeg
needs with apt, then builds FFmpeg, in one go.

## Build and test

```bash
tools/build-ffmpeg.sh x86_64 aarch64      # FFmpeg 7.1 with dav1d and zlib into third_party/
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD/third_party/ffmpeg/x86_64/lib
cargo test --workspace                    # GPU tests use any Vulkan device (lavapipe is fine)
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets   # lints are in [workspace.lints]
RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --workspace --no-deps
(cd tools/frame-desktop-install && python3 -m unittest)   # the Desktop Mode installer
shellcheck packaging/*.sh tools/*.sh      # as CI does
```

Under WSL, keep the Linux build off the Windows drive with
`export CARGO_TARGET_DIR=~/.cache/frameplayerx-target`, as
`tools/local-xr.sh` does.

## Code style

`cargo fmt` formats. Clippy, with the lints in `[workspace.lints]`, has to
pass with warnings denied, as it does in CI.

Comments say what the code can't:

- Each module starts with `//!`: what it is for, in a sentence or a short
  paragraph.
- `///` documents an item when its name and signature leave something out:
  units, what `None` means, that it blocks, what it costs. A field called
  `title` needs no `/// Title.`
- `//` inside a function says why: a hardware or server quirk, an
  invariant, a workaround and what it works around. Not what the next line
  does.
- Every `unsafe` block has a `// SAFETY:` comment saying why it is sound
  (clippy checks).
- No commented-out code. A known gap is an issue, not a `TODO`.

## Repository layout

| Crate | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `frameplayerx` | The app: the XR loop, the interface, and wiring everything together |
| `fp-core` | Shared types: formats and their detection, view settings, the source contract, data folders |
| `fp-ffmpeg-sys` | Bindings to the bundled FFmpeg 7.1, per architecture (`tools/gen-ffmpeg-bindings.sh`) |
| `fp-media` | Demuxing, decoding (V4L2 hardware, 10-bit HEVC as Q10C; software), the A/V clock, ALSA audio, subtitles, thumbnails |
| `fp-render` | The Vulkan renderer: the projection shader for every format, the Q10C to P010 conversion, egui panels, quads |
| `fp-xr` | OpenXR: the session and swapchains, controller input, eye tracking, passthrough |
| `fp-xr-loader` | Finds the active OpenXR runtime and loads it directly, with no Khronos loader to ship (shared with `frame-probe`) |
| `fp-library` | The SQLite database: folder scanning, the metadata and thumbnail worker, search, watch history |
| `fp-sources` | Sources: local folders, HTTP, WebDAV, DLNA, SMB, DeoVR and HereSphere feeds, Jellyfin and Emby |
| `fp-haptics` | Funscripts, the sync engine, and TCode, Buttplug and Handy devices |
| `fp-remote` | The DeoVR remote API and the phone web remote |
| `fp-updater` | Signed update manifests, download, install and rollback; the `fp-release` maintainer tool |
| `frameplayerx-install` | The PC installer: pairs with the headset and installs over SSH |
| `frame-probe` | Reports what a Steam Frame offers a native app (see [The platform probe](#the-platform-probe)) |

| Folder | What's in it |
|---|---|
| `assets/` | The logo (`logo.svg`), the Steam library artwork made from it, and the docs' install buttons |
| `site/` | The GitHub Pages site: the page the Frame Control button opens (see [Install buttons](#install-buttons)) |
| `packaging/` | What goes in the release zip besides the binary: the launcher, a README and the licences |
| `tools/` | Build, package, preview and test scripts |
| `tools/frame-desktop-install/` | The Desktop Mode installer: a Python script, and the install and uninstall `.desktop` launchers that download and run it (see its [README](../tools/frame-desktop-install/README.md)) |
| `tools/crash-relay/` | The Cloudflare Worker crash reports go to (see [Crash reports](#crash-reports)) |
| `vendor/smb/` | The `smb` crate with a credit-accounting fix (see `vendor/smb/PATCHES.md`) |

## How it fits together

**The app loop.** One loop owns the OpenXR session and the Vulkan device.
Each frame it reads the controllers, builds the interface with egui and
draws both eyes: the video through the projection shader, then the panels
as quads in the scene. Interface code doesn't change the app's state
itself: it returns `Action`s that `App::apply` carries out. Anything slow
(opening a video, browsing a server, scanning folders, checking for
updates) runs as a background job whose result comes back on a channel, so
a frame doesn't wait on the network.

**Video.** FFmpeg demuxes through fp-core's `ByteSource`, so every network
protocol is implemented in Rust and looks like a file to FFmpeg. H.264 and
HEVC go to the Frame's V4L2 stateful decoder; anything it can't take is
decoded in software. Frames are uploaded to Vulkan as YUV and converted in
the shader, which maps each pixel of each eye onto the video for the chosen
projection and stereo layout. HDR is tone mapped there too. 10-bit HEVC
comes out of the decoder as Q10C (Qualcomm's compressed TP10), which only
the GPU can read: `fp-render/src/q10c.rs` reads it through TP10 texture
descriptors made from Turnip's own (`VK_EXT_descriptor_buffer`) and turns
it into P010 planes in a compute pass.

**Sources and browsing.** Every source implements one `Source` trait
(`list`, `open`, `details`). Each kind gets its own browser in `ui/`:
`local.rs`, `folders.rs`, `jellyfin.rs` and `feeds.rs`, built from the
shared pieces in `ui/page.rs`. Browsing a network source writes nothing to
the database; a video gets a row when it's opened.

**Libraries and cards.** A library is a source (`SourceConfig::Library`)
whose folder is scanned into the database under its own id
(`Library::scan_folder`), on start, when its card is mounted, when its page
opens and on Scan now (`app/tasks.rs`). Files on microSD cards and USB
drives are located as `volume:<filesystem ID>/<path on the card>`
(`fp_core::volume`): the local source lists them so, the scanner stores
them so, and the opener resolves them to wherever the card is mounted, so
two cards with the same label and folders never share rows. A card's ID
comes from `/dev/disk/by-uuid`.

**Watch sync.** Servers that keep watch state (Jellyfin and Emby, HereSphere
APIs that name an `eventServer`) also implement `Source::watch_session` and
`Source::report_watch` (`fp-sources/src/watch.rs`). The open video's `Watch`
(`frameplayerx/src/watch.rs`) turns what the player does each frame into
events: start, pause, resume, seek, speed, a tick every 10 s, and stop. One
thread sends every report in order, so a video's stop reaches the server
before the next one's start, and quitting waits up to 3 s for it. A
server's resume point (`Entry::resume`) wins over the database's.

**Subtitles.** `frameplayerx/src/subtitles.rs` picks the track a video starts
with, from the Subtitles setting and the tracks' languages
(`fp_core::language` reads `ara`, `pt-BR`, `de.forced`). The player decodes
embedded tracks itself; files are loaded whole. Text cues are set by
cosmic-text (`ui/subtitle_text.rs`) with the system's fonts, loaded on a
thread at startup, so every script is shaped; egui sets them until then.

**Eye tracking.** `fp-xr/src/gaze.rs` reads the headset's gaze
(`XR_EXT_eye_gaze_interaction`) as an action set of its own, synced with
the controllers' in one `xrSyncActions`; it reaches the app as
`FrameInput::gaze`, a ray in the play space, only while the eyes are
tracked. `frameplayerx/src/gaze.rs` is what everything that follows the
eyes reads, and it falls back to the head's forward without them:
`GazeTracker::now` is the gaze as tracked, for what must keep up with
the eyes (the overlay's Eyes line; foveated rendering would read it),
and `GazeTracker::fixation` holds through saccades and blinks and smooths
tremor, for what wants the thing looked at (autofocus, which hands it to
the renderer as `VideoParams::focus`). `GazeTracker::landed` and
`unseen` (mid-saccade or blinking) reach autofocus as `autofocus::Eyes`:
it reads each fixation afresh and moves faster while a change goes
unseen. The preview's `gaze YAW PITCH`
simulates a tracker. Settings › General › Show where you look draws both
as red rings (`gaze::Ring`) on the panel or flat screen looked at: quad
layers over everything on the headset, lines in the preview's eyes.

**The database.** SQLite, with the schema version in `PRAGMA user_version`
and forward-only migrations in `fp-library/src/schema.rs`. The scanner
marks files missing rather than deleting them, so ratings, resume points
and adjustments survive a card being taken out.

**Data on the headset.**

| Folder | What's in it |
|---|---|
| `~/frameplayerx` | The app: binary, launcher, `lib/` (FFmpeg, dav1d), artwork, `VERSION` |
| `~/frameplayerx.old` | The previous version, kept for rollback |
| `~/.config/frameplayerx` | `settings.json`, `sources.json` (passwords, readable only by the user) and the optional `env` file |
| `~/.local/share/frameplayerx` | The database, `frameplayerx.log` (and `.log.old`), and `Interactive/`, searched for scripts not next to their video |
| `~/.cache/frameplayerx` | Thumbnails, scrub previews, and `feeds/`: each scene feed's last listing, shown at once the next time it's opened (readable only by the user: its URLs can carry the server's API key) |

## Running without a headset

### On this computer with Monado

`tools/local-xr.sh` runs FramePlayerX against [Monado](https://monado.freedesktop.org),
the open-source OpenXR runtime, so a change can be tried without building
and installing on the Frame. Monado shows both eyes in a desktop window and
fakes the headset and controllers from the keyboard and mouse. It works on
Ubuntu and Debian, and on Windows in Ubuntu under WSL2 (WSLg shows the
windows and plays the sound; Vulkan runs on llvmpipe there, so expect a low
frame rate).

```bash
tools/local-xr.sh setup                   # once: Monado, build tools, FFmpeg
tools/local-xr.sh run                     # Monado + FramePlayerX
tools/local-xr.sh run ~/Videos/clip.mp4   # ...opening a video
tools/local-xr.sh headless --exit-after 10 clip.mp4   # no window: smoke test
tools/local-xr.sh preview /tmp/shots      # every screen as PNGs (ui-preview.sh)
```

Click into Monado's debug window (*Monado!*) to drive it:

| Input | What it does |
|---|---|
| Keyboard and mouse | Move the headset |
| Left Ctrl / left Alt held | Move the left / right controller instead |
| WASD, Q/E | Move |
| Arrow keys, right-button drag | Turn |
| Left click | Trigger |
| Shift | Faster |

Its *Qwerty › Help* tab lists every key. The controllers present
themselves as Khronos simple controllers (select and menu), which
FramePlayerX binds.

- The window with the eyes opens at 1600×900; `LOCAL_XR_WINDOW=1280x720`
  picks another size, and it can be resized. Under WSL it's Monado's X11
  window, as the Wayland one stays black there.
- The eyes are 150% of the fake headset's 640×720.
  `XRT_COMPOSITOR_SCALE_PERCENTAGE=200 tools/local-xr.sh run` is sharper,
  `=60` smoother on a software renderer.
- Monado's log is in `/tmp/monado-service.log`; `-v` turns on
  FramePlayerX's debug log.

By hand, with Monado's simulated headset and no window:

```bash
XRT_COMPOSITOR_NULL=1 SIMULATED_ENABLE=1 monado-service &
XR_RUNTIME_JSON=/usr/share/openxr/1/openxr_monado.json \
  cargo run -p frameplayerx -- --exit-after 10 video.mp4
```

### The preview harness

`--preview` needs no OpenXR runtime at all: it renders offscreen with a
simulated head and right controller, driven by a script, and saves
screenshots. `tools/ui-preview.sh` uses it to render every screen; the
script commands are listed in `crates/frameplayerx/src/preview.rs`.

```bash
cat > /tmp/demo.fps <<'X'
wait 2
point main 0.24 0.04     # Watch history tab
click
shot history
open ~/Videos/clip_180_LR.mp4
wait-playing 20
shot playing
X
VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/lvp_icd.json \
  cargo run -p frameplayerx -- --preview /tmp/shots --script /tmp/demo.fps
```

### Other modes

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `frameplayerx --info FILE` | Prints what FramePlayerX detects about a video: format, streams, HDR |
| `frameplayerx --decode-bench FILE [--sw]` | Decodes without displaying and prints the decoder and frame rate |
| `frameplayerx --seek-test FILE\|URL` | Skips through a video headless, checking buffering and that hardware decoders are given back |

## On the headset

```bash
tools/build-frame.sh -p frameplayerx      # cross-compile for the Frame
tools/package.sh                          # release zip and manifests in dist/
frameplayerx-install --zip dist/frameplayerx-<version>-aarch64.zip
ssh frame tail -f .local/share/frameplayerx/frameplayerx.log
```

Builds target `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` with glibc 2.28, so they run on
any SteamOS image. `tools/package.sh` checks that the binary is ARM64,
needs nothing newer than glibc 2.28 and finds its libraries through
`$ORIGIN/lib`.

### Environment variables

Steam can't pass environment variables to an app, so the launcher reads
`KEY=value` lines from `~/.config/frameplayerx/env` before starting.

| Variable | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `FRAMEPLAYERX_REFRESH_RATE` | `90` | The refresh rate set in SteamVR's per-app settings for FramePlayerX, unless you chose one there. `0` leaves it alone |
| `FRAMEPLAYERX_RESOLUTION` | `2160` | Pixels per eye, set the same way (SteamVR's default is 1728). `0` leaves it alone |
| `FRAMEPLAYERX_DEBUG_INPUT` | | `1` logs each controller's input when it changes |
| `FRAMEPLAYERX_V4L2` | | `0` turns off the native V4L2 decoder |
| `FRAMEPLAYERX_V4L2_DEVICE` | | The V4L2 device to decode with, instead of the one found |

### Steam Frame notes

What the code relies on about the platform:

- SteamVR runs **on the headset** and is the OpenXR runtime. FramePlayerX
  finds the active runtime's manifest and talks to it directly, so there's
  no Khronos loader to ship.
- Native ARM64 apps run **outside the Steam Linux Runtime** container, so
  the release carries FFmpeg and dav1d in `lib/` and asks nothing newer
  than glibc 2.28 of the system.
- The Frame controllers have their own interaction profile,
  `/interaction_profiles/valve/frame_controller_valve`, from the
  `XR_VALVE_frame_controller_interaction` extension. Without it SteamVR
  presents them as Touch controllers.
- Eye tracking is `XR_EXT_eye_gaze_interaction`: one combined gaze ray, no
  per-eye directions, openness or pupils. SteamVR passes it to apps only
  when the user allows it, so an offered tracker may never report;
  `frame-probe` says whether the system supports it, and the app's log
  says "eye tracking: tracking" the first time it does.
- SteamVR's per-app video settings override what an app asks for through
  OpenXR, which is why the launcher sets the refresh rate and resolution
  there.
- The hardware decoder is a V4L2 stateful decoder for 4:2:0 H.264 (8-bit)
  and HEVC (8- and 10-bit). It's shared with Steam's own streaming, so it
  can be busy. It writes 10-bit pictures correctly only as Q10C: asked for
  NV12, it clamps the samples to 8 bits.
- Turnip has no TP10 images, though the GPU reads TP10. A TP10 texture
  reads wrongly past 2^24 samples, so 10-bit planes are read in bands.
- SteamOS only mounts ext4 microSD cards itself, and no USB drives;
  FramePlayerX mounts exFAT, FAT32 and NTFS itself under
  `/run/media/steamos/<name>`.
- Apps installed in Developer Mode appear in the Steam library as non-Steam
  games; `frameplayerx-install` writes that entry to `shortcuts.vdf`.

### The platform probe

`frame-probe` answers what a Frame offers a native app in one run: the
OpenXR runtime and its extensions, refresh rates, render size, swapchain
formats, controller profiles, V4L2 decoders, Vulkan Video and DMA-BUF
import. `tools/frame-probe.sh --build` builds it, runs it on a paired
headset and copies the text and JSON reports into `probe-reports/`.

## Releasing

1. Once: run `fp-release keygen`, paste the printed public key into
   `crates/fp-updater/src/lib.rs` (`RELEASE_PUBLIC_KEY`), and store the
   whole `.key` file as the `FP_RELEASE_KEY` repository secret. Keep the key
   offline otherwise.
2. Stable: push (or merge) to `main`. Beta: run the `ci` workflow on any
   other branch from the Actions tab (Run workflow). CI calculates the
   version, stamps it into `crates/frameplayerx/Cargo.toml`, builds,
   packages, signs `manifest.json` and publishes the GitHub release with
   the zip, `manifest.json(.sig)`, `framedrop.json`, `frameplayerx-install`
   for each PC, and the Desktop Mode installer and its install and uninstall launchers.

   - `main` gets the next stable `X.Y.Z` from the conventional commits
     since the last stable tag (`git cliff --bumped-version`): a breaking
     change (`feat!:`, `BREAKING CHANGE:`) bumps X, a `feat` bumps Y,
     anything else bumps Z. Beta tags don't count. With no stable tag yet
     it's `initial_tag` in `cliff.toml`.
   - Other branches get that version as `X.Y.Z-beta.N` (N one above the
     highest existing beta of it, and always above the latest stable),
     published as a GitHub pre-release. FramePlayerX offers it on the Beta
     update channel only.
   - Alpha: tick **Alpha** when running the workflow (any branch, `main`
     too) to get `X.Y.Z-alpha.N`, N being the run number, left as a draft
     pre-release. Only people with push access see a draft, and the app
     and `frameplayerx-install` never offer one, so install its zip by hand
     to test it, then run the workflow again without Alpha to release a
     beta (or merge for a stable release). Delete the draft once done; a
     draft has no tag until it is published.
   - Pushing a `vX.Y.Z` or `vX.Y.Z-anything` tag releases exactly that
     version (a pre-release if it has a `-`).

   The release starts as a draft: it is published, and becomes the latest
   unless it's a beta, only once every file is in and downloads back
   identical to the one built (an alpha stays a draft). A run that fails
   leaves a draft nobody sees, which the next run of that version replaces.

CI runs only GitHub's own Actions. Dependabot opens one pull request a
month with the crates' compatible updates (`Cargo.lock` only, within what
`Cargo.toml` allows), Rust (`rust-toolchain.toml`), the tools
(`tools/requirements.txt`) and the Actions. CI tests it like any pull
request; when a new Rust's clippy finds something, fix it on that branch.
Merging it releases, as any merge to `main` does. A breaking crate upgrade
(a new egui, say) needs code changes, so it's made by hand.

The app and `frameplayerx-install` find releases in GitHub's release list:
the highest version on the Stable channel without a `-` part, on Beta any
version (`releases/latest` never offers a pre-release). In-app updates
and `frameplayerx-install` without `--zip` only install releases whose
manifest is signed with the release key.

### Install buttons

The README's install buttons are images in `assets/`, because GitHub strips
the inline styles and SVG of the HTML buttons FrameDrop and Frame Control
publish. They all point at the latest release, so they need no change per
release:

| Button | Opens |
|---|---|
| Desktop Mode / Uninstall | The release's `Install-FramePlayerX.desktop` / `Uninstall-FramePlayerX.desktop` |
| FrameDrop | `https://framedropvr.com/install?manifest=` with the release's `framedrop.json`, FrameDrop's documented link: it opens FrameDrop, or FrameDrop's site when it isn't installed |
| Frame Control | `site/frame-control.html` on GitHub Pages, which opens `frame-control://install?manifest=` with the release's `frameplayerx.json`. GitHub doesn't keep links to app schemes like `frame-control://` in Markdown, so a web page has to |

`.github/workflows/pages.yml` publishes `site/` (with the logo) when it
changes on `main`. Once, in the repository settings: **Pages › Build and
deployment › Source: GitHub Actions**.

### Crash reports

The log records panics and fatal signals. When the previous run's log
(`frameplayerx.log.old`) ends in one, the next start shows a page saying
what a crash report contains and where it goes, with the report itself on
request; only **Send report** sends it. The report holds the app and
system versions, what happened, and that run's log (its first 8 KB and
last 40 KB) with every video title and location in the library, everything
in `sources.json` (libraries included), haptic devices, URLs, IP addresses,
email addresses, paths under home and media folders, and media file names
replaced by placeholders such as `<video 1>` (`crates/frameplayerx/src/crash.rs`).

It goes to `tools/crash-relay/`, a Cloudflare Worker that files it as an
issue in a private repository, so the GitHub token never ships in the app.
Without a relay (`REPORT_URL` is `None`), the app never asks. To set one
up, once:

1. Create a private repository for the reports (`REPO` in
   `tools/crash-relay/wrangler.toml`, `frameplayerx-crashes` by default).
2. Create a fine-grained GitHub token with access to that repository only
   and the **Issues: Read and write** permission.
3. In `tools/crash-relay/`, with a Cloudflare account:
   `npx wrangler login`, `npx wrangler secret put GITHUB_TOKEN` (paste the
   token), then `npx wrangler deploy`. Leave the Worker's logs off: the
   relay only uses the sender's address to rate-limit them (5 a minute).
4. Set `REPORT_URL` in `crates/frameplayerx/src/crash.rs` to the deployed
   URL plus `/report`, e.g. `Some("https://frameplayerx-crash-relay.<account>.workers.dev/report")`.

Check it with
`curl -X POST <url>/report -d '{"app":"frameplayerx","version":"test","summary":"test","text":"test"}'`:
`201` and a new issue. The preview's `crash-report` command shows the page
with a report made from its own log.

## Artwork

`assets/logo.svg` is the logo. `python3 tools/make-artwork.py` renders the
Steam library artwork in `assets/steam/` from it (needs Pillow and
`rsvg-convert`); re-run it after changing the logo.
